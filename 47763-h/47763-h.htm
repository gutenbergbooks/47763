<span class="smallfont">NEW BRIDGE&mdash;THE TAMAR&mdash;MORWELL ROCKS&mdash;CALSTOCK&mdash;COTHELE&mdash;PENTILLIE&mdash;LANDULPH</span></h2>

<p>The southern portion of the Cornish Coast may
be said to begin at the head of the navigation of
the river Tamar, at Weir Head, to which the
excursion steamers from Plymouth can come at
favourable tides, or a little lower, at Morwellham
Quay, where the depth of water permits of more
frequent approach. But barges can penetrate
somewhat higher than even Weir Head, proceeding
through the canal locks at Netstakes, almost
as far as that ancient work, New Bridge, which
carries the high road from Dartmoor and Tavistock
out of Devon into Cornwall.</p>

<p>From hence, then, at New Bridge, a hoary
Gothic work of five pointed arches with picturesquely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
projecting cutwaters, the south coast
of Cornwall may most fitly be traced. It is a
constant surprise to the explorer in England to
discover that almost invariably the things that
are called "new" are really of great age. They
were once new and remarkable things. There is
a "New Bridge" across the Thames, but it is the
oldest now existing. The town of Newmarket,
in Cambridgeshire, was a new thing in 1227, and
there are other "Newmarkets" of even greater
age. The subject might be pursued at great
length; but sufficient has been said to prepare
those who come this way not to expect some
modern triumph of engineering in iron or steel.</p>

<div id="Fig_i_019" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_019.jpg" width="600" height="298" alt="" />
<div class="caption">NEW BRIDGE.</div>
</div>

<p>New Bridge, three and a half miles west of
Tavistock, is approached from that town by the
old coach road and the new, descending with
varying degrees of steepness to the river. As you
come down the older and steeper and straighter
road, you see the bridge far below, and the first
glimpse of Cornwall beyond it, where the lofty
hills of Gunnislake rise, scattered with the
whitewashed cottages of the miners engaged in
the tin mines of the district. They, and the
large factory buildings below, near the river
level, are not beautiful, and yet the scene is of
great picturesqueness and singularity. A weird
building beside the bridge on the Devonshire side,
with two of its angles chamfered off, is an old
toll-house. Mines in working on the Devonshire
side belong to the Duke of Bedford, who has a fine
park and residence near by, at Endsleigh, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
he would not (according to his own account), be
able to maintain, together with various other
residences, including the palatial Woburn Abbey,
were it not for his vast income from the ground-rents
of what he was pleased to style "a few
London lodging-houses."</p>

<p>The surrounding country is dominated for
many miles by the cone-shaped Kit Hill, the crest
of the elevated district of Hingston Down, crowned
by a monumental mine-chimney.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Hingston Down, well wrought,</div>
<div class="verse indentbase">Is worth London, dear bought."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>So runs the ancient rhyme. It has been
"well wrought," not yet perhaps to the value
indicated above, and now its scarred sides are
deserted; but perhaps another instalment of
London's ransom may yet be mined out of it.</p>

<p>The riverside walk along the Cornish bank of
the Tamar is at first as smoothly beautiful as a
Thames-side towing-path. Thus you come past
the locks at Netstakes to the Morwell Rocks,
masses of grey limestone cliffs rising from the
Devonshire shore and hung with ivy and other
growths. Soon the Tamar falls over the barrier
of Weir Head, and then reaches the limit of the
steamship navigation, at Morwellham Quay. Words
and phrases seem colourless and inexpressive in
face of the sweet beauties of limestone crag and
winding river here; of the deep valley, wooded
richly to the hill-tops, and the exquisitely tender
light that touches the scene to glory. Nor is it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
without its everyday interest, for the excursion
steamers come up on favourable tides from
Plymouth and wind with astonishing appearance
of ease round the acute bends of the narrow
channel; the branches of overhanging trees
sweeping the funnels. The lovely valley is seen
in a romantic perspective from the summit of
the lofty hill that leads up to Calstock church,
for from that point of view you look down upon
the little peninsular meadows that now and again
give place to cliffs, and through an atmosphere of
silver and gold see the river winding past them,
like some Pactolian stream. Down there lie the
ruins of Harewood House, the old Duchy of Cornwall
office; across, as far as eye can reach, spread
the blue distances of Devon, and all along the
course of the river the hamlets are transfigured
to an unutterable beauty. Leave it at that, my
friends. Do not explore those hamlets, for, in
fact, they are neither better nor worse than others.
Like many among the great characters in history,
upon whom distance confers a greatness greater
than properly belongs to them, they have their
littlenesses and squalors.</p>

<p>Calstock church must be, and must always have
been, a prime test of piety, for it stands upon a
tremendous hilltop nearly a mile from the village,
and Calstock stands below by the water.</p>

<div id="Fig_i_023" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_023.jpg" width="600" height="358" alt="" />
<div class="caption">CALSTOCK.</div>
</div>

<p>Calstock is the Richmond and Hampton Court
of Plymouth. What those places are to London,
this is to the Three Towns of Plymouth, Devonport,
and Stonehouse; only the scenery is immeasurably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
finer than that along the Thames,
while, on the other hand, Cothele is not to be
compared with Hampton Court, nor is it so public.
Of all the many varied and delightful steamboat
trips that await the pleasure of the Plymouth
people, or of visitors, none is so fine as the leisurely
passage from Plymouth to Calstock and back,
first along the Hamoaze and then threading the
acutely curving shores of the Tamar, rising
romantically, covered exquisitely with rich woods.
At the end of the voyage from Plymouth, Calstock
is invaded by hungry crowds. One of the especial
delights of the place is found in its strawberries,
for the neighbourhood is famous for its strawberry-growing.
But the tourist, who is not often able
to set about his touring until the end of July,
is rarely able to visit Calstock in strawberry-time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and Plymouth people have the river in the tender
beauty of early summer, with strawberries to
follow, all to themselves. Here let a word of
praise be deservedly given to the extraordinarily
cheap, interesting and efficient excursions by
steamboat that set out from Plymouth in the
summer. Without their aid, and those of the
ordinary steam ferries, I know not what the
stranger in these parts would do, for the Plymouth
district is one of magnificently long distances,
and the creeks of the Hamoaze and the Tamar
are many and far-reaching. And latterly the
Calstock excursion has been advantaged by the
acquisition of the <em>Burns</em> steamer, one of the
London County Council's flotilla on the Thames
that cost the ratepayers so dearly. There are
shrewd people down at Plymouth&mdash;or as we say
in the West, down <em>tu</em> Plymouth&mdash;and when the
County Council's expensive hobby was abandoned,
these same shrewd fellows secured the
<em>Burns</em> in efficient condition for about one-twentieth
part of its original cost, and are now understood
to be doing extremely well out of it.</p>

<p>I could wish that Calstock were in better
fettle than it now is. He who now comes to the
village will see that it is completely dominated
by a huge granite railway viaduct of twelve spans,
crossing the river, and furnished with a remarkable
spidery construction of steel, rising from the
quay to the rail-level. This is a lift, by which
loaded trucks, filled with the granite setts, kerbs,
channelings, and road-metal chips, in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
local "Cornwall Granite Company" deals, are
hoisted on to the railway, and so despatched direct
to all parts. The evidences of the Granite Company's
special article of commerce are plentiful
enough, littering the riverside and strewing the
roads, just as though the Cornwall Granite Company
were wishful by such means to advertise their
goods; but since the opening of the new railway,
in 1909, the unfortunate lightermen and bargemen
of the place have been utterly ruined. The
Plymouth, District, and South-Western Railway,
whose viaduct crosses the river, has taken away
their old trade, and has not the excuse, in doing
so, of being able to earn a profit for itself.</p>

<p>Below Calstock, at the distance of a mile, is
Cothele, an ancient mansion belonging to the
Earl of Mount Edgcumbe. Steep paths through
woodlands lead to it, and the house itself is not
the easiest to find, being a low, grey granite building
pretty well screened by shrubberies. The
real approach, is, in fact, rather from Cothele Quay,
on the other side of the hill, away from Calstock.
Cothele is only occasionally used by Lord Mount
Edgcumbe, but it is not, properly speaking, a
"show house," although application will sometimes
secure admission to view its ancient hall
and domestic chapel.</p>

<p>Cothele, begun by Sir Richard Edgcumbe in
the reign of Henry the Seventh, is still very much
as he and his immediate successors left it, with
the old armour and furniture remaining. Richard
is a favourite name among the Edgcumbes. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
particular Sir Richard engaged in the dangerous
politics of his time, and very nearly fell a victim
to his political convictions. Suspected of favouring
the pretensions of the Earl of Richmond, he
was marked for destruction, and only escaped
arrest by plunging into the woods that surround
Cothele. From a crag overlooking the river he
either flung his cap into the water, or it fell off,
and the splash attracting attention, it was thought
he had plunged into the river, and so was drowned.
This supposition made his escape easy. He returned
on the death of Richard the Third and the
consequent accession of the Earl of Richmond,
as Henry the Seventh, and marked his sense of
gratitude for the providential escape, by building
a chapel on the rock, overlooking Danescombe.</p>

<p>A Sir Richard, who flourished in the time of
Queen Elizabeth, and was Ambassador to Ireland,
brought home the curious ivory "oliphants" or
horns, still seen in the fine hall, where the banners
of the Edgcumbes hang, with spears and
cross-bows and armour that is not the merely
impersonal armour of an antiquary's collection,
but the belongings of those who inhabited Cothele
of old. The most curious object among these
intimate things is a steel fore-arm and hand, with
fingers of steel, made to move and counterfeit as
far as possible the lost members of some unfortunate
person who had lost his arm. To whom
it belonged is unknown.</p>

<p>The tapestries that decorated the walls of
Cothele at its building still hang in its rooms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the furniture that innovating brides introduced,
to bring the home up-to-date, has long since
become the delight of antiquaries, and the extra
plenishings provided for the visits of Charles the
Second and George the Third and his Queen may
be noted. So do inanimate things remain, while
man is resolved into carrion and perishes in dust.
I find no traces of the Early Victorian furnishings
that probably smartened up Cothele for the
visit of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in 1846.
They are well away.</p>

<p>Many are the royal personages who have
visited Cothele. Sometimes they have been as
desolating as the merely vulgar could be; as,
for example, when one of them, disregarding the
very necessary request not to handle the curious
old polished steel mirrors that are numbered
among the curiosities of the mansion, did so,
with the result that a rusty finger-mark appeared.
Here was a chance for the reverential! A Royal
finger-mark, wrought in rust! It might have
served the turn either of a snob or a cynic, equally
well; but it was removed at last, not without
much strenuous labour.</p>

<p>Cothele Quay stands deep down by the riverside,
with a cottage or so near, but otherwise
solitary amid the woods, where the little creek
of Danescombe is spanned by an ancient Gothic
bridge. The quay is the port, so to speak, of
Cothele, and of the village of St. Dominic, high
up on the hills; the readiest way for supplies of
all kinds being from Plymouth, by water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Up there, through St. Dominic, the lofty high
road that runs between Callington and Saltash
is reached. It runs through the village of St.
Mellion, whose church contains monuments, some
of them rather astonishing, to the Corytons of
West Newton Ferrers, three miles to the west.</p>

<p>Passing through St. Mellion, the road comes
presently to the lovely park of Pentillie, a wooded
estate overlooking the Tamar in one of its loveliest
and most circuitous loops, where the river
may be seen through the woods winding and returning
upon itself far below. Hidden away in
luxuriant glades almost on a level with the river
is the mansion of the Coryton family, itself of
no great charm or interest; but there is on one
of the heights above it, known as "Mount Ararat,"
a weird "folly," or monument, rather famous
in its way, in which was buried, under peculiar
conditions, the body of a former owner of Pentillie,
who died in 1713. It is well worth seeing,
but in those woody tangles is not so easily to be
found. It stands, in fact, not so far from the
road itself, down a lane on the left hand before
coming to the lodge-gates of Pentillie, and then
through a rustic gate or two; but the stranger
might easily take the wrong one among the
several rough footpaths, and the whole hillside
is so overgrown with trees, that the tower is
not seen until you are actually at the base of it.
The better course is to proceed along the highway
until you come to the lodge-gates and to the
broad, smooth carriage-road leading lengthily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
down to the mansion. If you are on a bicycle, so
much the better; you are down there and in
the courtyard of Pentillie "Castle," as it is
called, in a flash. Proceeding then straight
through to the kitchen-gardens, there is a gardener's
cottage, where, to those gifted with a
proper degree of courtesy, the gardener will point
out the hillside footpath by which you presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
come to the tower, containing a forbidding
statue of Sir James Tillie. "An' if ye look through
a peephole in the wall," says the gardener, "ye
can see th' owd twoad quite plainly."</p>

<div class="caption">THE TOWER, PENTILLIE.</div>
</div>

<p>Sir James Tillie was a person of very humble
origin, born at St. Keverne in 1645. He was
soon in the service of Sir John Coryton, Bart., of
West Newton Ferrers, St. Mellion, who befriended
him to a considerable extent, placing him with
an attorney and afterwards making him his own
steward. In 1680 the baronet died. Meanwhile
Tillie, by industry and prudence, had grown
pretty well-to-do, and had married the daughter
of Sir Harry Vane, who brought him a fortune.
She had died some years before the decease of
Sir John Coryton, at whose death Tillie was a
childless widower. His master had arranged that
Tillie should continue steward to his eldest son,
John, the next baronet, and guardian to his
younger children. It was not long before the
second Sir John died, and Tillie married his
widow, and seems in the thirty years or so following
to have been undisputed owner of Pentillie.
How all these things came to pass does not exactly
appear; but at any rate Tillie, who by false
pretences of gentility and a considerable payment
of money had secured the honour of knighthood
in 1686, built Pentillie Castle, which he named
after himself, and formed the park, and there
he resided until his death in 1713. His wife
survived him. He had no children, but was
anxious to found a Tillie family, and left a will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
by which his nephew, James Woolley, son of his
sister, should inherit his estates on assuming the
name of Tillie.</p>

<p>Wild and fantastic legends fill up the mysterious
lack of facts here and there in Tillie's life.
He is said to have poisoned Sir John Coryton the
younger, and was, among other things, reputed
to be a coiner, on a large scale, of base coin. But
there is no evidence for those tales. More certain
it is that the College of Heralds in 1687
revoked the grant of arms to him, and fined him
£200 for the mis-statements that led to his obtaining
them.</p>

<div id="Fig_i_031" class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_031.jpg" width="300" height="471" alt="" />
<div class="caption">SIR JAMES TILLIE.</div>
</div>

<p>A vein of eccentricity certainly ran through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the composition of this remarkable man. His
"castle" has been rebuilt, but contains a life-size
leaden statue of himself that he had made,
in voluminous periwig and costume of the period,
holding a roll of documents. His will contained
some remarkable provisions, including instructions
for the building of the tower and for his body
to be laid there, with a seated stone statue of
himself. These instructions, repeated and noted
down by a succession of writers, have lost nothing
of their oddity. Thus Hals tells us that Tillie
left directions that his body, habited in his hat,
gloves, wig, and best apparel, with shoes and
stockings, should be fastened securely in his chair
and set in a room in the tower, with his books and
pen and ink in front of him, and declared that
Tillie had said he would in two years come to
life and be at Pentillie again. The chamber in
which his body was to be set was to have another
over it containing portraits of himself, of his
wife, and his nephew, to remain there "for ever."
The upper chamber many years ago fell into
decay, and the portraits were removed to the
mansion; and no one knows what became of
Tillie's remains. His scheme of founding a Tillie
family failed, and the property eventually came
into possession of descendants of the Coryton
family, through the marriage of Mary Jemima
Tillie, granddaughter of Sir James Tillie's nephew,
with John Goodall, great-grandson of Sir John
Coryton the younger's daughter, who assumed
the name of Coryton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>The brick tower of "Mount Ararat," now
open to the sky and plentifully overgrown with
ivy, is approached by moss-grown stone steps.
A lobby at the summit of them ends in a blank
wall with a kind of peep-hole into the space
within, not at all easy to get at. Any stranger
peering through, and not knowing what to expect,
would be considerably startled by what he saw;
for directly facing the observer is the life-size
effigy of a ferociously ugly, undersized man, with
scowling countenance and great protruding
paunch, seated in a chair and wearing the costume
of the early eighteenth century. The statue is
of a light sandstone, capable of high finish in
sculpture; and every detail is rendered with
great care and minuteness, so that, in spite of
the damp, and of the ferns and moss that grow
so plentifully about its feet, the statue has a
certain, and eerie, close resemblance to life. It
is so ugly and repellent that the sculptor was
evidently more concerned about the likeness than
to flatter the original of it.</p>

<p>The Tamar may be reached again in something
over two miles, at Cargreen, a hamlet at
whose quay the steamers generally halt. It is a
large hamlet, but why it ever came into existence,
and how it manages to exist and to flourish
in a situation so remote, is difficult to understand,
except on the supposition that the barge traffic
has kept it alive. Landulph, a mile away, on a
creek of its own, and not so directly upon the
main stream, is a distinct parish with an ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
church, but it has not the mildly prosperous air
of Cargreen, and indeed consists of only two or
three easily discernible houses. The fine church
contains a mural brass to Theodore Palæologus,
who died in 1636, at Clifton in Landulph, one of
the last obscure descendants of the Palæologi, who
were Emperors of Byzantium from the thirteenth
century until 1453, when the Turks captured
Constantinople and killed Constantine Palæologus,
the eighth and last Emperor. He was brother of
Thomas Palæologus, great-great-grandfather of
the Theodore who lies here.</p>

<p>The reasons for this humble descendant of a
line of mighty autocrats living and dying in
England are obscure, but he appears to have
attracted the compassionate notice abroad of some
of the Lower family, who brought him home with
them and lent him their house of Clifton. Here
he married one Mary Balls in 1615. Although
he is sometimes stated to be the last of his race,
this is not the fact, for of his five children three
certainly survived him. John and Ferdinand
have left no traces. Theodore, the last of whom
we have any knowledge, became a lieutenant in
the army of the Parliament, and died and was
buried, not unfittingly for the last representative
of an Imperial line, in Westminster Abbey, in
1644. Mary died a spinster, in 1674, and was buried
at Landulph. Dorothy, who in 1656 married a
William Arundel, died in 1681, and it is not known
if she left any descendants.</p>

<p>The brass bears a neat representation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smallfont">SALTASH&mdash;SALTASH BRIDGE&mdash;TREMATON CASTLE&mdash;ST.
GERMANS&mdash;ANTONY&mdash;RAME&mdash;MOUNT EDGCUMBE&mdash;MILLBROOK</span></h2>

<p>The name "Saltash" simply means "salt water"&mdash;the
"ash" having originally been the Celtic
"esc." Salt water is found, as a matter of fact,
as far up river as Calstock, but here it is, by all
manner of authorities, that the river Tamar,
the "taw mawr," or "great water," joins that
broad and often extremely rough and choppy
estuary, the Hamoaze: "Hem-uisc," the border
water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption">PLYMOUTH SOUND, THE HAMOAZE, AND THE TAMAR.</div>
</div>

<p>Saltash is a borough-town of an antiquity
transcending that of Plymouth, and the rhyme</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Saltash wer' a borough town,</div>
<div class="verse indentbase">When Plymouth wer' a vuzzy down,"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>is equally proud and true. It was once also a
Parliamentary borough, but that glory has faded
away. Yet once more, it is in Cornwall, and
that, according to any true Cornishman, is far
better than being in Devonshire. So Saltash is
amply blest. And if to these dignities we add
the material advantage of possessing jurisdiction
over Hamoaze, down even to Plymouth Sound,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and over all its creeks, we shall see that Saltash
does right to be proud. It was by virtue of the
borough authority over those waterways that
Saltash was enabled to be so splendidly patriotic
in the time of good Queen Bess. At that period
the harbour dues were one shilling for an English
ship, and two shillings for a foreigner. After the
Armada Saltash levied an extra discriminatory
five shillings upon Spanish vessels. Among
the Corporation regalia is a silver oar, typifying
this jurisdiction.</p>

<div id="Fig_i_039" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_039.jpg" width="600" height="314" alt="" />
<div class="caption">SALTASH BRIDGE.</div>
</div>

<p>It is perhaps a little grievous, after all these
noble and impressive things, to learn that Saltash
church, which crests the hill on whose steep sides
the town is built, is really, although very ancient,
not a church, but a chapelry of St. Stephen's, a
quite humble village inland, on the way to Trematon.
And there is one other thing: Saltash
cannot see its own picturesqueness, any more
than one can see the crown of one's head, except
for artificial aid. The mirror by which Saltash
is enabled to see itself is the Devonshire shore,
and across the quarter of a mile to it the steam-ferry,
that plies every half-hour or less, will take
you for one penny. From that point of view,
not only Saltash, but also the best picture of
Saltash Bridge is to be had: that giant viaduct
which carries the Great Western Railway across
from Devon to Cornwall in single track, at a
height of 100 feet above the water. Saltash
Bridge&mdash;no one calls it by its official name, the
"Royal Albert Bridge"&mdash;has in all nineteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
spans, and is 2,240 feet long; but its great spectacular
feature is provided by the two central
spans of 455 feet each. Twelve years were
occupied in building, and it was opened in 1859.
The name of I. K. Brunel, the daring engineer,
is boldly inscribed on it. There is a story told of
some one asking Brunel how long it would last.</p>

<p>"A hundred years," said he.</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Then it will no longer be needed."</p>

<p>There is a good deal more work in Saltash
Bridge than is visible to the eye, the stone base
of the central pier going down through seventy feet
of water and a further twenty feet of sand and
gravel, to the solid rock. The cost of the bridge
is said to have been £230,000.</p>

<p>Great ships may easily pass under the giant
building, and old wooden men-o'-war lie near at
hand, giving scale to it, including the <em>Mount Edgcumbe</em> training-ship,
the <em>Implacable</em>, and an
old French hulk.</p>

<p>This way came the Romans into Cornwall,
their post, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Statio Tamara</i>, established on the
Devonshire side at what is now King's Tamerton.
And this way came the Normans, building a strong
fortress nearly two miles west of Saltash, at
Trematon, on a creek of the Lynher river. They
are "proper rough roads" and steep that lead
to Trematon Castle. You come to it by way of
the hamlet of Burraton Combe and the village
of St. Stephen's-by-Saltash. At Burraton some
old cottages are seen with a half-defaced tablet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
on them, once covered over with plaster. Most
of the plaster has now fallen off, revealing this
inscription, which some one, long ago, was evidently
at some pains to conceal:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="blockquotehang">"This almshouse is the gift of James Buller of Shillingham,
Esq., deceased, whose glorious memory
as well as illustrious honours ought not to be
forgotten but kept, as 'tis to be hoped they will,
in euerlasting remembrance, decem<sup>r</sup>. y<sup>e</sup> 6 in y<sup>e</sup>
yeare of our Lord 1726."</p></blockquote>

<p>A shield, displaying four spread eagles, surmounts
these praises to the illustrious Buller,
whose honours and glorious memory are indeed
clean forgot.</p>

<p>Trematon Castle stands on the summit of
a mighty steep hill, rising from a creek branching
out of a creek. At the head of this remote tongue
of water, where the salt tide idly laps, stands the
hamlet of Forder. Turner painted Trematon
Castle, and in his day the crenellated walls of that
amazing strong place could easily be seen from
the creek. In these latter days the trees of the
Castle hill have grown so tall and dense that little
of the ancient stronghold can be glimpsed. A
carriage-road winds up the hill, for a residence&mdash;not
in the least pretending to be a castle, one is
happy to say&mdash;stands in midst of the fortress
precincts.</p>

<div id="Fig_i_043" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_043.jpg" width="600" height="301" alt="" />
<div class="caption">TREMATON CASTLE.</div>
</div>

<p>It is a peculiar castle, the "keep" crowning
a lofty mound, difficult of access, heaped upon the
highest point of the hill, resembling that of Totnes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and some two or three others in the West country,
which exhibit vast circular battlemented walls,
evidently never roofed nor intended to be roofed.
Below this keep is a wide grassy space now occupied
by the mansion and its beautiful rose and
other gardens. Entrance to this court was
formerly obtained by a strong gateway tower still
remaining, but not now forming the approach;
and around this court ran another massive battlemented
wall, most of it existing to this day, and
enclosed the castle. Such was the ancient hold
of the Valletorts, afterwards the property of the
Duchy of Cornwall. Carew finely describes the
"ivy-tapissed walls"&mdash;it is a pretty expression,
thus likening the ivy to tapestry&mdash;and tells us
how the Cornish rebels of 1549, standing out for
the old religion, treacherously invited the governor,
Sir Richard Grenville, outside, on pretence of a
parley, and then captured the castle and
plundered at will. Then "the seely gentlewomen,
without regard of sex or shame, were stripped
from their apparel to their very smocks, and some
of their fingers broken, to pluck away their rings."</p>

<p>Just below Trematon Castle, passing under a
viaduct of the Great Western Railway, the creek
opens out upon the broad and placid Lynher
river, exactly resembling a lake, as its name
implies. Here are the four or five cottages of
Antony Passage, including a primitive inn.
Antony is nearly half a mile across the ferry, but
the Lynher, or "St. Germans River," as it is
sometimes called, should certainly be explored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
by boat for its length of four miles to St. Germans,
the prettily situated village where the
ancient bishopric of Cornwall was seated from its
beginning in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 909 until its transference to
Exeter in 1046; and where Port Eliot, the park
and mansion of the Earl of St. Germans, is placed.
Ince Castle, a curious brick-built sixteenth-century
building, peers from the wooded shores on
the way. An Earl of Devon built it, and the
Killigrews held it for a time. The house has a
tower at each of its four corners, and according
to legend, one of the Killigrews, a kind of double-barrelled
bigamist, kept a wife in each tower,
ignorant of the others' existence.</p>

<div id="Fig_i_046" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_046.jpg" width="600" height="350" alt="" />
<div class="caption">ST. GERMANS.</div>
</div>

<p>St. Germans, from being a borough, has declined
to the condition of a village, and a very
beautiful and aristocratic-looking village it is.
The parish church stands on the site of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
cathedral of the ancient See of Cornwall, and,
although practically nothing is left of the original
building, the great size and the unusual design
of the existing church in a great degree carry on
the traditional importance of the place. You
perceive, glancing even casually at the weird exterior,
with its two strange western towers, square
as to their lower stages and octagonal above, that
this has a story more important than that of a
mere parish church. The dedication is to St.
Germanus of Auxerre, a missionary to Britain in
the fifth century. The importance of the building
is due to its having been collegiate. The noble,
if strange, west front is largely Norman, the
upper stages of the towers Early English and
Perpendicular. The interior is Norman and Perpendicular.
It will at once be noticed that there
is no north aisle. It was demolished towards the
close of the eighteenth century, in the usual
wanton eighteenth-century way. The only remaining
fragment of the ancient collegiate stalls
is a mutilated miserere seat worked up into the
form of a chair. It is carved with a hunting-scene;
a sportsman carrying a hare over his
shoulder, with animals resembling a singular compromise
between pigs and dogs, in front, and
huge hell-hounds with eyes like hard-boiled eggs,
following.</p>

<p>St. Germans church is practically a mortuary
chapel of the Eliot family, and it stands, too,
in the grounds of their seat, Port Eliot, with the
mansion adjoining.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<div id="Fig_i_048" class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i_048.jpg" width="450" height="257" alt="" />
<div class="caption">MISERERE, ST. GERMANS.</div>
</div>

<p>It was in 1565 that the Eliots first settled
here. The Augustinian Priory and its lands had
been granted at the Dissolution to the Champernownes,
who exchanged it with the Eliots, who
came from Coteland, in Devon. The greatest of
the Eliot race, Sir John, Vice-Admiral in the
West, and patriot Member of Parliament in resistance
to the arbitrary rule of Charles the First,
paid the penalty of his patriotism by death in the
Tower of London in 1632, after four-and-a-half
years' captivity. His body does not lie here.
"Let him be buried in the parish in which he
died," wrote the implacable king; and he lies
in the church of St. Peter-ad-Vincula, on Tower
Green, instead of at St. Germans, where his own
people would have laid him.</p>

<p>Many monuments to Eliots stud the walls, and
hatchments gloom in black and heraldic colours,
bearing their inspiring motto, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Præcedentibus insta</i>,
<em>i.e.</em>, "Urge your way among the leaders," suggested,
no doubt, by the career of their great
ancestor; but the inspiration has never been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
keen enough to produce another great man from
among them, and since the Earldom of St. Germans
was conferred in 1815 the Eliots have been
respectably obscured.</p>

<p>The Lynher river ends just beyond St.
Germans at the village of Polbathick. Other
creeks branch out on either hand, like fingers;
beautifully wooded hillsides running down to
them. At low water they are mostly mud flats,
with the gulls busily feasting in the ooze, but
when the tide flows they become still lakes,
solitary except for a few "farm-places" along
their course. On a knoll, high above the Lynher,
the spire of Sheviock church peeps out. It is
simply bathed in stucco. Carew gives an amusing
legend relating to the building of the church, and
tells how one of the Dawney family built it,
while at the same time his wife was engaged in
building a barn. The cost of the barn was supposed
to have exceeded that of the church by three-halfpence;
"and so it might well fall out, for it
is a great barn and a very little church." It is
a quaint legend, but there is no satisfaction to be
got in visiting the church, for it is not a "very
little church," and the barn with which it was
compared is not now in existence.</p>

<p>Below Sheviock comes Antony, sometimes
called "Antony-in-the-East," to distinguish it
from the two other Antonys, or Anthonys, in
Cornwall. Antony village stands high up on
the hillside, and the park and mansion of the
same name, seat of the Pole-Carew family, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
nearly two miles away, down by Antony Passage,
where the Lynher makes ready to join Hamoaze.
The park of Thanckes adjoins.</p>

<p>Antony church is approached by long flights
of steps. It contains a monument to Richard
Carew, of Antony, author of the "Survey of
Cornwall," published in 1602, a work of mingled
quaintness and grace. He died in 1620, as his
epitaph shows. The part of it in Latin was
written by his friend, Camden; the English verses
are his own.</p>

<p>Antony lies directly upon the old coach road
from Plymouth to Liskeard and Falmouth, three
miles from Torpoint, to which a steam-ferry,
plying every half-hour, brings the traveller from
Devonport. Turner is said to have greatly admired
the view from the churchyard, but it is
greatly obscured in our own times by trees. The
grandest of all views is the astonishingly noble
panoramic view of Plymouth and the Hamoaze,
from the summit of the road to Tregantle Fort.
There the whole geography of the district is seen
unfolded, mile upon mile, with the three towns
of Plymouth, Devonport, and Stonehouse&mdash;to
say nothing of Stoke Damerel, Ford, Morice
Town, and St. Budeaux&mdash;looking like some city
of the Blest, which we know not to be the case,
and the great railway bridge of Saltash resembling
an airy gossamer. It is a view of views. Incidentally,
the panorama explains the existence
here of Tregantle Fort, and of that of Scraesdon,
down by Antony. This elevated neck of land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
commands Plymouth, which, with the arsenals
and dockyards of Devonport and Keyham, could
be either taken in the rear or bombarded by an
enemy who could effect a landing in Whitesand
Bay. Tregantle Fort, mounting many heavy
guns, therefore stands on the ridge, to prevent
such a landing, and a fine military road runs
between it and Rame, a distance of three miles,
skirting the cliffs of Whitesand Bay. From the
hillsides you see the soldiers firing at targets in the
sea&mdash;and never hitting them. The way to Rame,
along this military road, crosses lonely downs,
with the tempting sands of Whitesand Bay down
below. The dangers of this treacherous shore,
often pointed out by guide-books, are made
manifest by an obelisk beside the road, on the
brink of the low cliffs, bearing an inscription to
"Reginald Spender, aged 44, and his sons Reginald
and Sidney, aged 13 and 11, who were drowned
while bathing, Whit Sunday, June 9th, 1878."</p>

<p>At the end of the military road and its numerous
five-barred gates, the village of Rame, consisting
of a small cluster of a church and some
farms screened by elms, stands in a sheltered fold
of the hills. The church, with needle spire, is
an almost exact replica of that of Sheviock, and,
like it, has been covered with rough-cast plaster,
as thoroughly as a twelfth-cake is faced with
sugar. It contains a poor-box pillar, dated 1633.
The lighting arrangements are in the primitive
form of paraffin candles on wooden staves. Rame
Head, almost islanded from the mainland, is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
western point of the bold promontory that encloses
the Cornish side of Plymouth Sound. Penlee
Point is the eastern. "When Rame and Dodman
meet" is a West-country way of mentioning the
impossible. The two headlands are twenty-seven
miles apart, in a straight line. Fuller, who dearly
loved a conceit of this kind, tells us that the
meeting did actually come to pass when Sir Piers
Edgcumbe, who owned Rame, married a lady
who brought him the land including the Dodman.
The small chapel of St. Michael on Rame Head,
long in ruins, has been restored by Lord Mount
Edgcumbe.</p>

<p>Penlee Point looks directly upon the Sound:
an inspiring sight in the Imperial sort. It is
indeed an epic of Empire, that broad waterway,
three miles across, with the great Breakwater
straddling in its midst, and shipping busily coming
and going, and forts on land and battleships on
sea. And I wish the walking were not so rough,
and the near contact with the forts a little more
martial and not so domestic. It resembles tricks
upon travellers to find that the signals flying from
Picklecombe Fort are not really, you know,
signals when seen close at hand, but shirts hung
out to dry.</p>

<p>And so presently round to Cawsand Bay.
First you come to Cawsand and then Kingsand,
villages not easily to be distinguished from one
another. Notorious in the eighteenth century
for being a nest of daring smugglers, these places
nowadays form excursion resorts for afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
trippers from Plymouth, and almost every house
supplies teas and refreshments. But in spite of
the crowds that resort to Cawsand and Kingsand,
they are sorry places, with a slipshod, poverty-stricken
air. Only the splendid views make them
at all endurable.</p>

<p>Mount Edgcumbe is one of the great attractions
for the people of Plymouth. It is, of course,
the private park of the Earl of Mount Edgcumbe,
but the Plymouth people have by long use come
to look upon the usual free access to it very much
as a right, and the excursion steamers from
Plymouth to Cremyll would receive a severe blow
if the permission to wander here at large were
withdrawn. The Duke of Medina-Sidonia, Admiral
commanding the Spanish Armada, is said
to have selected Mount Edgcumbe as his share of
the spoil, when England should be conquered.
Contrary from all reasonable expectations, there
was no conquest, and consequently no spoils.</p>

<p>Maker church, on the heights above Mount
Edgcumbe, commands panoramic views over
Hamoaze, and its tower was used in the old
semaphore signalling days, in connection with
Mount Wise at Devonport and the fleets at sea.</p>

<p>The proper local pronunciation of "Hamoaze"
is shown in the ode written by a parish clerk of
Maker:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Mount Edgcumbe is a pleasant place,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">It looketh on Hamoaze,</div>
<div class="verse indentbase">And on it are some batteries</div>
<div class="verse indent1">To guard us from our foes."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Equally fine, and more pictorially manageable
views are those from the "ruined chapel" down
below. The "ruin" is indeed a sham ruin, and
was simply built for effect, but a fine effective foreground
it makes, with all Plymouth massed over
yonder, and the Hoe with Smeaton's old Eddystone
tower prominent, and in the middle distance
the fortified rock of Drake's Island.</p>

<div id="Fig_i_055" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_055.jpg" width="600" height="403" alt="" />
<div class="caption">PLYMOUTH AND DRAKE'S ISLAND, FROM MOUNT EDGCUMBE.</div>
</div>

<p>A deep inlet runs inland past Cremyll to Southdown
and Millbrook, whither frequent ferries
also ply, at astonishing penny fares. At Millbrook,
too, every other house supplies teas to
hungry and thirsty crowds. You would not say
the waters of Millbrook creek were altogether
salubrious, and the steamers' paddles stir them up
sometimes with desolating effect upon the nose,
but the mackerel do not seem to be adversely
affected. Indeed, they appear rather to affect
these turbid and odorous waters, and may often
be seen from the steamers leaping up into the air.
There are few more beautiful sights than those
on the return from Millbrook to Plymouth on a
summer evening, when the moon peers over the
wooded shores and the mackerel leap and glitter
in her silver light.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smallfont">DOWNDERRY&mdash;LOOE&mdash;TALLAND&mdash;POLPERRO&mdash;LANTEGLOS-JUXTA-FOWEY</span></h2>

<p>The country of this Mount Edgcumbe peninsula
is beautifully wooded. Inland from Millbrook towards
Antony again, you come to St. John's, a
pretty village, with an old church and plenteous
elms. And then, having explored the peninsula,
the way out to the coast line on to Looe is up
again to Tregantle, whence a coastwise road
leads past Crafthole and Portwrinkle to Downderry.
Those places may easily be dismissed,
together with the coast on which they stand.
They are quite recent collections of houses,
mostly of an extremely commonplace plastered
type, devoted to letting lodgings for the summer
months. Their situation has nothing to recommend
it, for the coastline here is quite bald and
uninteresting, and the country immediately in
the rear is for the most part treeless downs.
Downderry is the largest of these settlements.
Those who merely follow the coast-road through
Downderry will never appreciate the exquisite
appropriateness of that name. The gradients
that way are not steep. But let Downderry be
approached from the direction of St. Germans, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the steep two-miles' descent shall prove there to
be something in a name. At the same time, it is
but fair to add that the name did not derive from
the hills, but from <i lang="kw" xml:lang="kw">Dun-derru</i>, <em>i.e.</em> "Oak Bank."</p>

<p>Beyond Downderry the road descends to a
marshy valley crossed by a small stone bridge,
at the point where a stream hesitates between
percolating through the sands and running back
upon itself to convert the marshy vale into a lake.
This is marked on the maps "Seaton," but for
town or village, or even hamlet, the stranger
will look in vain. From this point it is a long
four miles into Looe, and I can honestly say that,
whichever way you go, by the road leading inland,
and incidentally as steep as the roof of a house,
or by the cliffs, in places considerably steeper, you
will wish you had gone the other way. For
indeed both ways are deadly dull. Coming on a
first occasion by road the reverse way, from Looe,
an old man, indicating the way, remarked that
it would be a very good road "ef 'twadden for
th' yills. Ye goo up th' yill, and ye tarn" (I
forget where you turn), "an' then ye goo straight
down th' yill to Satan."</p>

<p>As one had not at that time heard of Seaton,
this final descent had a certain awful speculative
interest.</p>

<p>Even the cliff route into Looe ends at last.
There, almost hanging over the brink of Looe, as
it were, you realise for the first time, in all the
way from Rame, that you are really in Cornwall,
for the coast has hitherto lacked the rugged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
beauty that is found almost everywhere else.
But Looe makes an honourable amende. It
might not unfittingly typify Cornwall. Conceive
two closely-packed little towns down there (for
there are two Looes, East and West), fringing the
banks of an extremely narrow and rocky estuary,
widening as it goes inland; and imagine just
offshore on the further side a craggy island, and
there you have the seaward aspect of the place.
Looe has been considerably altered during the
last few years, but it can never be a typical seaside
place; its physical peculiarities forbid that.
It has no sea-front, and possesses only the most
microscopic of beaches, just large enough to hold
a few boats and to launch the lifeboat. The life
of the Looes, East or West, is all along the streets
and quay beside the estuary. The place is, as it
were, a smaller Dartmouth, but with the added
convenience of a bridge crossing the Looe River,
half a mile from the sea.</p>

<p>The Looe River is partly an actual river, but
very much more of a creek: a lakelike creek at
high water, dividing above the bridge into two
creeks, into which freshwater streams trickle
from Liskeard and the Bodmin moors. Looe,
in fact, takes its name from these lakelike
estuaries. It signifies "lake," and has a common
ancestry in the Welsh "llwch" and the Gaelic
"loch." Thus in speaking of Looe River "we
admit not only a redundancy but actually a contradiction.
There are two Looes, or lakes, the
East and the West, just as there are the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
towns so-called. Between these two waters, three
miles inland, is the rustic village of Duloe, whose
name is supposed to have originally been "Dew
Looe," <em>i.e.</em>, the Two Looes. "But there has
always been great variety of opinion about this,
and old writers on Cornwall have variously considered
it to be "Du Looe," or "God's Lake,"
or "Du Looe" (spelled the same way), "Black
Lake." A resourceful antiquary has, in addition,
pointed out the difficulties of finding the true
origin of place-names by advancing no fewer than
six other possible origins:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
Dehou-lo = south pool.<br />
Dour-looe = water lake.<br />
Dewedh-looe = boundary lake.<br />
Du-low = black barrow.<br />
Dewolow = the devils.<br />
Du (or tu) looe = Lake-side.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<img src="images/i_061.jpg" width="600" height="292" alt="" />
<div class="caption">LOOE.</div>
</div>

<p>The "black-barrow" or "devils" derivations,
it is said, might come from the remains of a prehistoric
stone circle still existing at Duloe, where
eight stones from four to ten feet high, are still
standing. They may have once formed an awe-inspiring
sight to the early peoples who gave
names to places.</p>

<p>The foregoing is, however, only an exercise
in possibilities, intended as a warning to those
who make certain of meanings; the probabilities
rest with "Dew Looe."</p>

<p>East Looe, formerly called Portuan, as its old
borough seal shows, is the larger of the twin towns.
It has a Town Hall, retaining the porch of an older<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
building with the old pillory; and a church whose
only old part is a singularly sturdy and clumsy
tower. It is equally puzzling to find the church
and the tiny beach of Looe in the maze of narrow
alleys. West Looe has also its church, very
much of a curiosity, in a humble way. Its slender
campanile tower, properly introduced into a view,
makes a picture of the brother town across the
water. Years ago, this church was desecrated in
many ways. Among other uses it was made to
do duty for a town hall and as a room for
theatrical entertainments.</p>

<p>Along the West Looe water is the lovely inlet
of Trelawne Mill, just above the bridge, with dense
woods clothing the hillsides and mirrored in the
still waters. Here is Trelawne, seat of the Trelawny
family since the time of Sir Jonathan
Trelawny, Bishop of Bristol, and afterwards
successively of Exeter and Winchester, one of the
Seven Bishops sent to imprisonment in the Tower
of London by James the Second in 1688. The
"Song of the Western Men," written by Hawker,
using the old refrain, "And shall Trelawny die?"
refers to that occasion:&mdash;</p>

<p>The "Jolly Sailor" Inn at West Looe is perhaps
the most picturesque building in the little
town, whose long steep street goes staggering up
towards Talland, and its toppling chimney is
a familiar object. It is not so much an accidental
as an intentional slant, designed to counteract
the down-draught of the winds.</p>

<div class="caption">THE "JOLLY SAILOR," LOOE.</div>
</div>

<p>Talland, situated on the hill overlooking the
solitary bight of Talland Bay, is just a church, a
vicarage, and the old manor-house of Killigarth.
The church is one of the six in Cornwall which
have detached towers. The others are St. Feock,
Gunwalloe, Mylor, Lamorran, and Gwennap.
Part of Talland church is Early English, the
rest Perpendicular. It contains, among other
memorials, a monument to "John Bevyll of
Kyllygath," 1570, with an effigy of him carved in
relief on slate, and a long metrical epitaph, full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of curious obsolete heraldic terms. If you seek
to know anything of the marryings and intermarriages
of the Bevill family, be sure that this
monument sets them forth in full detail; and the
fine bench-ends take up the story, and tell it
abundantly in shields of many quarterings.</p>

<div class="caption">TALLAND CHURCH.</div>
</div>

<p>Talland was in the old smuggling days exceptionally
notorious for the frequent landings of
contraband on the lonely little beach below the
church, and "Parson Dodge" was a famous
devil-queller and layer of spirits, far and near.
But he could not, or would not, lay the mischievous
sprites who haunted his own churchyard,
and were, in fact, not supernatural beings at all,
but smugglers in disguise, whose interests lay in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
making Talland a place to be shunned at nights.
There is a great deal of smuggling history connected
with Talland, and among the grotesque
epitaphs in the churchyard there is even one to
the memory of a smuggler, who was shot in an
encounter with the Preventive Service.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>The cliffs between Talland and Polperro are in
places fast crumbling away, and no one seems in
the least concerned to do anything; perhaps because
anything that might be done would presently
be undone again by the sea. "Ye med so well
throw money in the sea as spend et on mending
they cliffs," is the local opinion. At Polperro
itself the cliffs are of dark slate, and seem almost
as hard as iron.</p>

<p>I suppose no one will deny Polperro the dignity
of being the most picturesque village on the south
coast of Cornwall. The place-name means
"Peter's Pool," and the sea does indeed exactly
form a pool in the little harbour at high water,
retreating entirely from it at the ebb. The
entrance from the open sea is a narrow passage
between headlands of dark slate, whose characteristic
stratification produces weird spiny outlines
and needle-like points, inclined at an angle
to the horizon. On the western of these two
headlands formerly stood a chapel dedicated to
St. Peter, the peculiar patron of fishermen. Instead
of anything in that sort, the cliffs now exhibit
a monster black and white lattice hoarding, as
though a mad Napoleon of advertising had proposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
to celebrate some one's pills and soap, and
had been hauled off to a lunatic asylum before he
could complete his project. A similarly hideous
affair infests the cliffs by Talland, a mile away.
They are, however, not advertising freaks, but
structures placed by the Admiralty to mark a
measured mile for the steam-trials of new vessels.
The artist-colony at Polperro, a large community,
is rightly indignant at this uglification, but fortunately
it is not seen all over Polperro.</p>

<p>The little town is in every way a surprise and
a curiosity, and in most ways a delight. The
stone piers that project from either side of the
entrance to the harbour leave a space for entrance
so narrow that it is commonly closed in stormy
weather by dropping stout baulks of timber into
grooves let into the pier-heads. The chief industries
of Polperro are the pilchard-fishery and
the painting of pictures, and it is because of the
commercial, as well as the æsthetic, interest of
the artistic community, in preserving the old-world
picturesqueness of Polperro, that the wonderful
old place remains so wonderful and retains
its appearance of age. The rough cobble-stones
that have mostly disappeared from other fisher
villages are left in their wonted places, and when
the local authority a little while ago removed
some, in the innovating way that local authorities
have, the loud cries of protest that were made
speedily caused the replacement of them. I do
not think there is any other place, even in Cornwall,
which is situated in so sudden and cup-like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
a hollow as Polperro, and with houses so closely
packed together and staged so astonishingly
above one another. Port Loe nearly approaches
it, but that place is much smaller.</p>

<div id="Fig_i_068" class="figcenter" style="width: 589px;">
<img src="images/i_068.jpg" width="589" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">OLD BRIDGE, POLPERRO.</div>
</div>

<p>The time for sketching and seeing Polperro at
its best is in the sweet of the morning, before the
tender light of the sun's uprising has given place
to the fierce sunshine of the advancing forenoon.
A pearly opalescent haze then pervades the scene,
in which the shadows are luminous. Then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
smoke from the clustered chimneys of Polperro
ascends lazily from the sheltered hollow: breakfast
is preparing. Polperro is unquestionably in
many ways old England of the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, surviving vigorously into
the twentieth. The artist, sketching here, is
startled at frequent intervals by glissades of slops,
flung by housewives, adopting the "line of least
resistance," over the rocks into the harbour. It
is a custom that makes him nervous at first, but
he gets used to it. At Polperro, it is always
well, in seeking a picturesque corner, say half-way
down, below any houses, to make quite
sure (if in any way possible to make sure),
that one is not in the line of discharge of any
liquids or solids that in more conventional places
are deposited in the ash-bin or thrown into the
sink.</p>

<p>Many odd old cottages remain here, some of
them with outside staircases, and most roughly
built of granite and slate, and whitewashed. The
chief industry of Polperro is evident, not only in
the fishy smells, or in the fishing-boats and the
appearance of the people; but its specialised
character is hinted at by the sign of the humble
"Three Pilchards" inn on the quay, near the old
weigh-beam. Good catches of pilchards or bad
make all the difference here, where these peculiarly
Cornish fish are largely prepared and packed for
export to Italy. An Italian packing-house has
indeed an establishment on the quay. The salted
pilchards, long since known among the Cornish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
as "Fair maids" from the Italian "fumadoes"&mdash;the
original method of preserving them having
been by drying in smoke&mdash;are the chief source of
the Polperro fishermen's livelihood. Thus the
time-honoured toast of these otherwise sturdy
Protestants:</p>

</div>

<p>Others beside the fisherfolk rejoice when the
fishery is good. I refer to the gulls. Nowhere
is the seagull happier than in Cornwall, if immunity
from attack and the certainty of plenty
to eat constitute happiness in the scheme of
existence as it is unfolded to gulls. The Wild
Birds' Protection Act is scarcely necessary for
the protection of gulls in Cornwall, and the birds
are so used to this affectionate tolerance that it
might almost be denied that they are wild, except
technically. I am afraid the gull presumes not a
little upon all this. He seems to know that the
fishermen dare not punish him, if sometimes they
feel inclined, for to ill-treat a gull is notoriously
the way in Cornwall to bring bad luck; and
although they are incredibly ravenous eaters of
fish, it is one of the fisher-folk's most deeply rooted
convictions that the boats are lucky in proportion
to the numbers of gulls that accompany them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
There is, of course, a good reason at bottom for
this, because the gulls are the first to note the
whereabouts of the fish, and scream and swoop
down upon the shoals long before any human eye
can detect their existence. The gulls go out with
the boats and come back with them, and often
they are the first to return; the winged couriers
who awaken the little port with news of the home-coming
of its men.</p>

<p>When the boats are in harbour, the gulls are
at home, too. Every roof-ridge is alive with
them, and they even take an intelligent interest
in the domestic cooking. It is one of the most
ridiculous sights to observe a gull perched on the
edge of a chimney-pot smelling the odours that
come up from cottage chimneys. When the tide
is out, the gulls quest diligently in the ooze and
scavenge all the offal that is plentifully flung into
the harbour, for there is nothing nice in the feeding
of a gull. Dead kittens and dogs come as handy
and as tasty morsels as potatoes and cabbage-stalks.
I have even seen a gull steal and bolt
a pudding-cloth; but what happened to him
afterwards I don't know. There are, indeed, few
things a gull will not steal. The dogs and cats in
Polperro have even developed a way of furtively
glancing up at the roofs, for the gulls swoop down
like lightning when the cats' dinners are put outside,
and their food is gone on the instant. Thus
you will notice the cats run to cover with their
meal, while the dogs do the like, or are careful to
place one paw on their bone, lest it be snatched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
away in a twinkling. Nay, worse; the gull
ashore will kill rabbits, rob nests, steal chickens,
and poach young pheasants; and the "jowster"
who hawks fish through the villages not infrequently
finds his stock depleted through the same
agency. And yet the gull is suffered gladly. He
is the most privileged and the hungriest thief in
existence.</p>

<p>A valley road leads inland from Polperro to
the hamlet of Crumplehorn, a pretty spot whose
name originated I know not how. The coastwise
road goes through Lansallos to Fowey.</p>

<p>"A bit of a nip" they call the sharp road on
the way to Lansallos, by which you see that the
old word "knap," for a hill, is degenerating.
Lansallos church tower, in rather a crazy condition,
is a prominent landmark. The coast-line
beyond Lansallos juts out at Pencarrow Head,
a "cliff-castle" promontory, whose name comes
from "Pen-caerau," the fortified headland. There
are several shades of meaning in "caer," of which
"caerau" is the plural form. It may indicate
a town, a castle, a dwelling, or a camp, just as a
dwelling in remote times was of necessity fortified
against attack.</p>

<p>Lanteglos, inland from Pencarrow, is like
Lansallos, lonely, but it is tenderly cared for,
after long neglect. The full name of it, "Lanteglos-juxta-Fowey,"
sounds urban. The tall
granite, fifteenth-century canopied cross, standing
by the south porch, was discovered some eighty
years ago, buried in the churchyard. Among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
brasses in the church is one for John Mohun and
his wife, who died in 1508 of the "sweating sickness."</p>

<p>Polruan, the "Pool of St. Ruan," at the foot
of the steep road leading down from Lanteglos,
is a sort of poor relation of the prosperous town
and port of Fowey over there, across the so-called
"Fowey River," which here and for five miles
up inland is a salt estuary, with smaller divergent
creeks. The beauty of Fowey and its river unfolds
with new delights at every stroke of the
oars, as the ferry-boat, gliding through the translucent
green sea-water, brings one across to the
town quay.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smallfont">FOWEY&mdash;THE FOWEY RIVER&mdash;ST. VEEP&mdash;GOLANT&mdash;LERRIN&mdash;ST.
WINNOW&mdash;LOSTWITHIEL</span></h2>

<p>The old town of Fowey, "Foy," as it is called,
and was in old times often spelled, has a stirring
history, resembling that of Dartmouth, even as
its appearance and situation are reminiscent of
that Devonshire port. Leland tells us that "The
glorie of Fowey rose by the warres in King
Edward I. and III. and Henry V.'s day, partly
by feats of warre, partly by pyracie, and so
waxing rich, fell all to marchaundize." The
"Fowey Gallants," for such was the title by
which the seamen of the port were known, or by
which perhaps they styled themselves, were not
good men to cross, and they had a high and
haughty temper that brought them into conflict
even with men of Rye and Winchelsea. It seems
that ships were expected to salute on passing
those Cinque Ports, but the men of Fowey refused,
and being called to account for it, beat the Sussex
men, and further added to their offences by adding
the arms of Rye and Winchelsea to their own;
an indignity felt acutely in those times, when one
might perhaps pick a man's pocket with less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
offence than to assume his armorial bearings.
The men of Fowey were well known and dreaded
by merchant vessels in the Channel; for, no matter
the nationality, they practised piracy on all and
sundry. They landed, time and again, on the
French coast when we were at peace with France,
and plundered, and burnt, and killed. The French
stood this for some time, but were on several
occasions obliged to fit out expeditions in revenge;
and no one who reads of the ways of those shocking
bounders can feel in the least sorry when he
reads how the foreigners landed one night, in the
reign of Henry the Sixth, and fired Fowey, and
killed several of the townsmen. The lesson could
not, however, be sufficiently enforced, for the
tough Fowegians rallied and drove the French
again aboard.</p>

<p>At length, after centuries of turbulence, the
privileges of Fowey were taken away, about 1553,
and given to Dartmouth, which itself was a nest
of pirates and buccaneers. But a good deal of
fight seems to have been left in Fowey, and its
sailors in the time of Charles the Second rendered
good service against the Dutch.</p>

<p>The houses of Fowey press closely against one
another, and line the water very narrowly, and
its "streets" are rather lanes. The greatest
glory of the town is the fine church of St. Finbar,
whose tall pinnacled tower, built of Pentewan
granite, yellow with age, is elaborately panelled.
Behind it rise the battlemented and still more
elaborately panelled towers of Place (not Place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
"House" as it is often redundantly styled), seat
of the Treffry family. But most of the old-time
houses have in these later years been ruthlessly
destroyed, and the lanes of Fowey are becoming
as commonplace as a London suburb. Nay, even
more, a suburb of London would be ashamed of
the tasteless, plasterful houses and vulgarian
shop-fronts that have lately come into existence
here. It is a sorrowful fact that the West Country
is the last stronghold of plaster and bad taste
and that things are now done here, of which the
home counties grew ashamed a generation ago.
Lately the old "Lugger" inn, almost the last
picturesque bit of domestic architecture in Fowey,
has been rebuilt. Readers of "Q's" stories of
"Troy Town," by which, of course, Fowey is
meant, will not, in short, now find their picturesque
expectations realised.</p>

<div id="Fig_i_079" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_079.jpg" width="600" height="423" alt="" />
<div class="caption">FOWEY: ST. FINBAR'S CHURCH, AND "PLACE."</div>
</div>

<p>The last warlike experiences of Fowey, apart
from the amusing antics of the volunteers enrolled
to withstand the expected French invasion under
Napoleon, celebrated by "Q," were obtained in
the operations that included the surrender of
the Parliamentary army here in 1644. The visit
of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in 1846 is
celebrated in a misguided way, by a granite
obelisk of doleful aspect on the quay. It would
add greatly to the gaiety of Fowey if it were
disestablished.</p>

<p>St. Finbar, to whom the fine church is dedicated,
was Bishop of Cork. He is said to have
been buried in an earlier church on this site.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
The existing church, built 1336&mdash;1466, is one of
the few in Cornwall possessing a clerestory.</p>

<p>There are interesting monuments of the Rashleighs
of Menabilly here; the old family that
came from Rashleigh in mid-Devon, but even
then bore a Cornish chough in their curious and
mysterious arms. Their heraldic shield includes,
among other charges, the letter T, but the meaning
of it being there is unknown, even to the
Rashleighs. The family formerly owned Fowey.
It was their Parliamentary pocket-borough, and
only their nominees could be elected. But this
valuable privilege passed from them in 1813,
I know not how. It suggests, however, that the
Rashleigh punning motto, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nec temere, nec timide</i>,&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>
"Neither rashly nor timidly," had in some
way ceased to regulate their doings.</p>

<p>The Treffrys, too, are well represented in
monuments and epitaphs, as it is only right they
should be, considering that their house, Place,
adjoining the church, has been their home for
many centuries. They were settled here long
before the Rashleighs, but are now really extinct
in the male line. The great J. T. Treffry, builder
of the harbour at Par and constructor of the
Cornwall Minerals Railway, and other works, was
an Austen before he assumed the name by which
he is better known.</p>

<p>A former vicar of Fowey, the Rev. Dr. Treffry,
who flourished in the early part of the nineteenth
century, before character had ceased in people,
and every man had his own noticeable peculiarities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
was outspoken to a degree. It is recorded
that few dared let the offertory-bag pass without
a contribution, for if he noticed the omission his
voice would be heard in a stage whisper saying,
"Can't you spring a penny? I paid you an
account last week."</p>

<p>No method of exploring the country on either
side of the Fowey River is to be compared, for
ease and beauty, with that of taking boat on the
rising tide, and so being borne smoothly along
those exquisite six miles to Lostwithiel. Here,
and for a long way up the estuary, is deep water
and safe anchorage for large vessels, as the pretty
sight of weatherworn ships anchored over against
Bodinnick shows; their tall masts and graceful
spars contrasting with the wooded hills, and
hinting of strange outlandish climes to the nestling
hamlets.</p>

<p>Bodinnick is, like Polruan, a ferry village, opposite
Fowey. It looks its best from the water.
A mile up, on the same side, a creek opens to
St. Veep, a sequestered church dedicated to a
saint called by that name. Her real name was
Wennapa, aunt of St. Winnow, and sister of
Gildas the historian.</p>

<p>The Cornish way of dealing with saints' names
may seem to some delightfully intimate, and to
others a profane familiarity, almost as bad as it
would be to style St. John "Jack," but the West
Country saints are to the Evangelists and to the
major saints what Irish and Scotch peers are to
peers of the United Kingdom; or perhaps, better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
still, what Knights Bachelors are to Dukes. I do
not mean to say that they have not seats among
the rest of the sanctified, but they are decidedly of
a lower grade; a good deal more human and less
austere than the great and shining ones. And
when we find, as often we do find among the
Irish, Welsh, native Cornish, or Breton saints,
that entire families have attained to that state,
we do right to look shyly upon their title.</p>

<p>Further up the Fowey River, on our left side,
we come to Golant and the church of St. Samson,
or Sampson, dedicated to a sixth-century Breton
saint, who early fled his country and was educated
in Wales, and then settled in Cornwall. Finally
he returned to Brittany (when he thought it quite
safe to do so), and died Bishop of Dôl.</p>

<p>Passing Penquite, which means "Pen coed"&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>
"head of the woods"&mdash;a creek opens on the
right, to Lerrin, a picturesque hamlet on the hillside,
where the creek comes to an end, and the
futile comings and goings of the sea die away in
ooze. A prehistoric earthwork, running inland
between Lerrin and Looe, is locally attributed to
the Devil, in the rhyme:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"One day the Devil, having nothing to do,</div>
<div class="verse indentbase">Built a great hedge from Lerrin to Looe."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>"Hedge," to any one from the Home Counties,
indicates a boundary formed by growing bushes.
In Cornwall it is often either a rough stone or
earthen bank.</p>

<p>Above Lerrin Creek is St. Winnow, a fine old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
church standing by the waterside. St. Winnoe
is an obscure saint. He was son of Gildas, the
pessimist historian of the woes of Britain at the
coming of the Saxons. There is some good old
stained glass in St. Winnow church, and an
inscribed font (inscription not decipherable).</p>

<p>This perhaps plumbs the depths of tortured
conceits, with its back and forth play upon
"William Sawle," "I am well," and the resemblance
of "Soul" to "Sawle": a closer
resemblance in the speech of the West Country
than it would appear in print to be. Any day the
stranger in Devon and Cornwall may, for instance,
hear the common salutation, "Well, how be 'ee

<p>"Aw, pretty tidily, thank 'ee."</p>

<p>There is no village of St. Winnow, only a
farmhouse and a vicarage, at the foot of a hill,
bordered by a noble beech avenue.</p>

<p>About a mile above St. Winnow, the narrowing
stream comes to Lostwithiel quay, where the
navigable Fowey River ends.</p>

<p>"Lostwithiel!" I like that name. It is
musical. To repeat it two or three times to one's
self is an ineffable satisfaction. One is immediately
seized, on hearing it, with a desire to
proceed to the town of Lostwithiel. Romance,
surely, lives there. Foolish country folk in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
neighbourhood, noting that great heights rise all
around the little town, say the meaning of its
name is "Lost-within-the-hill." I blush for them,
for it means nothing of the sort; but who wants
to attach a meaning to that melody? Not I, at
any rate, and I care little whether it be properly
"Les Gwithiel," the Palace in the Wood, or the
"Supreme Court." The old palace indicated is
the ancient Duchy House, a seat of the early Dukes
of Cornwall, who also had their Stannary courts,
that is to say, their tin-mining tribunals, here.
The buildings, much modernised, in part remain;
and up in the valley of the Fowey,
one mile further inland, are the remains of their
stronghold, Restormel, properly "Les-tormel,"
Castle.</p>

<p>There is not much of Lostwithiel. Past the
railway station, and over the nine-arched, partly
thirteenth-century bridge across the river Fowey,
and you are in a town of about two thousand inhabitants,
which looks as though it accommodated
only half that number. Yet, small though it be,
it is divided into two parts, Lostwithiel proper,
and Bridgend, and has a Mayor and Corporation.
The central feature and great glory of Lostwithiel
is the lovely octangular stone spire and lantern
of its parish church of St. Bartholomew, a work of
the Decorated, fourteenth-century period of architecture,
before which most architects very properly
abase themselves in humble admiration, while
many hasten to adopt its beautiful lines for their
own church designs. Lostwithiel spire has, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
especial, been the model for the spires of many
latter-day Wesleyan and Congregational chapels.</p>

<img src="images/i_089.jpg" width="400" height="581" alt="" />
<div class="caption">FONT, LOSTWITHIEL.</div>
</div>

<p>The description of architecture without the aid
of illustration is a vain and futile thing, and what
the likeness of this work is let the drawing herewith
attempt to show. The tower itself is an
earlier building, of the thirteenth century, but
tower and spire taken together are of no great
height&mdash;about 100 feet. The effective tracery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
of the eight windows surmounted by gables is all
of one pattern, except a window on the north
side, whose feature is a wheel. The font is one
of the most remarkable in Cornwall. It seems to
be of the fourteenth century. Its five legs are
of different shape. The strangest feature of its
eight sculptured sides, which include a most
clumsy and almost shapeless representation of
the Crucifixion, is a curious attempt at a hunting
scene, rendered in very bold relief. A huntsman on
horseback is shown, holding a disproportionately
large hawk on one upraised hand, and a queer-looking
dog bounds on in front, in a ludicrous
attitude. This font is historically interesting, as
figuring in the disgraceful doings of the Parliamentary
troops, who in 1644 occupied Lostwithiel
and used the church as a stable; baptizing a
horse at it, and calling it "Charles," as Symonds,
the diarist trooper, tells us, "in contempt of His
sacred Majesty."</p>

<p>Probably one of the longest leases on record
is alluded to, on a stone in the wall of a shed at
the corner of North Street and Taprell's Lane,
in the inscription: "Walter Kendall of Lostwithiel
was founder of this house in 1638. Hath
a lease for three thousand years, which hath beginning
the 29th of September, Anno 1632."</p>

<p>There is little in Fowey for the landsman. Its
chief delights are upon the water: boating or
sailing on the river, or yachting out to sea.
Yachtsmen are familiar figures, both at the inns
and hotels of the actual town, and at the new hotel
outside, overlooking the Channel from Point
Neptune. A thirsty yachtsman, asking for some
"Cornish cider," revealed by accident one article
at any rate which Cornish local patriotism does
not approve. The Cornishman, it appeared, although
believing in most things Cornish, drew the
line there, and Devonshire cider was offered instead,
with the admission that, although there
<em>was</em> Cornish cider, no one who could possibly help
themselves would drink it.</p>

<p>The coast round past Point Neptune and by
the wooded groves of Menabilly, on to Polkerris,
a queer little fisher-village, is much better made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the subject of a trip by sailing-boat than a tramp
along those rugged ways; and then, returning,
the direct road from Fowey to Par may be taken,
past the lodge-gates of Menabilly, at Castle Dour.</p>

<p>The name originated in "Castell Dwr"&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>,
the "Castle by the Water"&mdash;an ancient granite
post, or cross, known as the "Longstone." It
is seen standing on a plot of grass in the road.
This is the tombstone of a Romanised Briton, and
formerly bore the inscription, "<span class="smcap">CIRVSIVS HIC
IACIT CVNOMORI FILIVS</span>," plainly. It is not now
so easily read.</p>

<p>Soon the way leads almost continuously down
hill to Par. On the hedge-bank to the right is a
striking modern wayside cross, bearing the inscription,
"I thank Thee, O Lord, in the name of
Jesus, for all Thy mercies. J. R., May 13, 1845,
1887, 1905." It was erected by the late Jonathan
Rashleigh, of Menabilly.</p>

<p>At the foot of the hill is Par. The name of
the place means, in the Cornish language, a marsh,
or swamp, and Par certainly lies almost on a
level with the sea, where a little stream wanders
out of the Luxulyan Valley on to the sands of a
small bay, opening to the larger bay of Tywardreath.
The original character of this once
marshy spot is very greatly hidden by the many
engineering and other works established here by
J. T. Treffry. Here his Cornwall Minerals Railway,
running across country to the north coast
at Newquay, comes to his harbour; and his mines,
canal, and smelting works make a strange industrial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
medley, through whose midst runs the
main line of the Great Western Railway.</p>

<p>The great enterprises of that remarkable man
have long since suffered change. His railway is
now the Newquay branch of the Great Western,
his mines and canal have fallen upon less prosperous
days, and the great chimney of the smelting-works,
235 feet high&mdash;"Par stack," as it is called&mdash;no
longer smokes. The pleasant humour of
the neighbourhood long since likened silk hats,
the "toppers" of everyday speech, to the big
chimney, and he who wore one was said to be
wearing a "Par stack."</p>

<div class="caption">THE BISCOVEY
STONE.</div>
</div>

<p>There is no gain in the scenic way by following
the coast from Par to Charlestown. Nothing of
any outstanding character appears along those
coastwise paths, which are long and obscure.
This is not to say that the road inland is in any
way delightful. It is, in fact, a plaguey ill-favoured
road, for when you have left the various
railway bridges and junctions of Par behind, you
come to a very Gehenna of a place; a sterile
plain through whose midst the highway proceeds
bumpily. Many years ago the miners turned the
land at this point inside out, in search of copper,
and now that they have long left it, the place
remains the abomination of desolation, where
nothing will grow amid the mundic and heaps
and hollows of tailings. South of the road at
Biscovey, past this desolate region, stood an
ancient granite cross, minus its head, but still
seven feet eight inches high, known as the "Biscovey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Stone," and serving the humble office of
a gatepost. It was in 1896 removed to Biscovey
churchyard. Its original function was that of
a monument to one Alroron, and
it bears on its two broad sides,
amid curiously interlaced decorative
patterns, the inscription
"&mdash;Alroron Ullici Filivs&mdash;."</p>

<p>The dusty road leads through
Holmbush, a suburb of Charlestown,
which took its name from
the wayside "Holly Bush" inn.
Charlestown itself is more curious
than beautiful. It is, in fact, the
port of St. Austell, of which it is
really an extension, and was formerly
called Polmear. Charlestown
is a place with one small,
but very busy and crowded dock;
and the dock and the quays, and
all the roads into and out of the
place are a study in black and
white, and barrels. The stranger
to Cornwall, proceeding westward
for the first time, is apt to be
puzzled by these strange evidences.
He has come, unaware, upon the
first signs of the great and prosperous Cornish
china-clay industry. The whiteness of everything
that is not black is caused by the leakage
of the china-clay, and the blackness of everything
that is not white is the result of coal-dust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>China-clay is a substance greatly resembling
chalk, and varying from a putty-like consistency
to a powdery brittleness. A little of it is inevitably
dropped in the cartage down from
Carclaze, inland, where it is got, through St.
Austell, and down to the port, and a little more
is spread about in loading the vessels that take
it abroad; and so, as "mony a mickle makes a
muckle," there is generally a good deal of china-clay
pervading the place. The mountains of
clean new barrels, just fresh from the cooper's,
are for packing the clay for export. Charlestown
also does an import trade in coal, hence the
alternative to Charlestown's sanctified whiteness,
but when it rains, as it not infrequently does in
Cornwall, the result here is a grey and greasy
misery, compact of these two substances.</p>

<p>China-clay is decomposed granite, rotted by
the action of water during uncounted thousands
of years. Up at Carclaze and further inland, at
St. Stephen's-in-Brannel, it is dug out of quarries
that were once open workings for tin. The deposits
are of great depth and extent. Although so
easily dug out, the white clay in its natural state
is mixed with hard and gritty particles of quartz,
and has therefore to be subjected to a refining
process, to separate that undesirable element.
The method of separation is very simple, the
clay being subjected to a washing by which the
heavy, useless particles remain, and the soft
material is carried down into a series of tanks.
There it is left to settle, and the water is then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
drawn off. The clay is then allowed to dry, and
is finally dug out and packed in barrels. Modern
improvements in the preparation of china-clay
have been chiefly directed to the quick-drying of
the masses in these tanks, and minutes are now
taken instead of the months formerly occupied in
natural evaporation. China-clay, it may be added,
is used for many other purposes than the manufacture
of porcelain, and, although the Staffordshire
and foreign potteries use it largely, it is
extensively employed in loading calico, and in
giving inferior cottons a specious and illusory excellence.
It enters also into the composition of the
heavier and more highly glazed printing papers,
chiefly those used for printing illustrations.</p>

<p>St. Austell and Carclaze owe their prosperity,
in the origination of all these things, to William
Cookworthy, who first discovered china-clay in
England. He has his memorial in Plymouth,
where he lived for many years, for one of the
fine series of modern stained-glass windows in
Plymouth Guildhall shows him as chemist and
porcelain-maker; but the landowners of Carclaze
and the people of St. Austell have certainly fallen
short of their duty by failing to set up a statue
of him in some prominent place.</p>

<p>William Cookworthy, a native of Kingsbridge,
in South Devon, was born in 1705, one of the
seven children of another William Cookworthy,
a weaver, who died early and left his widow and
family with very narrow means. They owed
their sustenance, and the children owed their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
education, to the Quakers of Kingsbridge. William
was apprenticed to a chemist and druggist, and
eventually established himself in the same way
of business, wholesale, at Plymouth. The firm of
Bevan &amp; Cookworthy prospered early, and Cookworthy
at thirty-one years of age very largely
freed himself from its cares and devoted himself
to preaching. Ten years later, in 1745, he became
interested in kaolin, or china-clay, which
until 1708 had been found only in China, giving
that country the entire output of porcelain, which
from the land of its origin obtained its very
name of "china." Cookworthy, in common with
several other of his contemporaries, wished to
produce "china," and when news came in 1745
that china-clay had been found in Virginia, he
commissioned a Quaker friend to obtain some for
him. Travelling much in Cornwall, he himself
discovered a coarse variety of it on Tregoning Hill,
in Germoe, and a little later found the great
deposits at Carclaze, in the parish of St. Stephens,
behind St. Austell.</p>

<p>In that year, 1758, he began experimentally
making porcelain at Plymouth. Already, in 1709,
Dresden china was being made from the kaolin
found in Saxony, and a little later than his own
beginning the Sèvres porcelain factory was using
a deposit found at Limoges. He was joined by
Lord Camelford, and a patent for making china
was obtained in 1768, but the Plymouth factory
was not at any time remunerative, and the works
were removed to Bristol and eventually into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Staffordshire. Cookworthy died in 1780, not in
any way advantaged by his discovery.</p>

<p>The town of St. Austell&mdash;"Storsel," locally&mdash;does
not in the least know how it came by that
name. An altogether uncertain "Augustulus"
has been presumed, while others think they find
glimmerings of a hermit "St. Austolus." It is
a town of narrow, crowded streets, with little of
interest apart from the fine parish church, chiefly
of the early part of the fifteenth century. The
font, however, is Norman, of the very marked
Cornish type, consisting of a bowl supported on
four legs ending in grotesque faces. The fine
Perpendicular tower and the south aisle, richly
carved in the stubborn granite with numerous
shields and devices bearing the emblems of the
Passion and Crucifixion, are among the most
ornate in Cornwall.</p>

<p>A mysterious inscription, whose meaning is
still hotly debated, is found above the west door,
immediately surmounting a sculptured group
representing the "pelican in her piety." The old
story of the pelican wounding her breast&mdash;"vulning
herself," ancient writers call it&mdash;for the
sustenance of her young, is here thought to
typify the sacrifice made by our Blessed Lord and
Saviour for our sakes; and in this light the inscription
above may be read. The rudely sculptured
letters of it form the words and initials&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="smallfont">KY CH</span> (or <span class="smallfont">RY DU</span>)</div>
<div class="verse indentbase"><span class="smallfont">INRI</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>The original view was that <span class="smallfont">RY DU</span> was the
correct rendering, signifying in the Cornish language
"God is King." Of the meaning of <span class="smallfont">INRI</span>
there can, of course, be no question; it is "Jesus
Nazarenus Rex Judæorum." It is now sometimes
held that, as the lower line is Latin, the
upper is Greek, and is a contraction for Kyrius
Christus, <em>i.e.</em>, "Christ is Lord." Yet other attempts
take us into the Syro-Ph&oelig;nician and
Hebrew tongues, and read the meanings, "Dearly
Beloved," or, "He gave us His blood." But no
one will ever definitely put the question to rest.</p>

<p>There is but one other really interesting object
in St. Austell. That is the famous, but mysterious,
Mengu, or Menagu, stone, removed of late
from the Market Place to the spot known universally
in St. Austell (but not officially named), as
"Fool's Corner." It is placed, or was placed, it
is said, where the boundaries of the three manors
of Trenance&mdash;Austell, Treverbyn, and Towington&mdash;met.
A brass plate fixed upon it in 1892 gives
a certain modicum of information respecting this
slab, but it is little enough, and to this day
the words written by Walter White, in his
"Londoner's Walk to the Land's End," of 1854,
hold good. "Enquire," he says, "for anything
remarkable in the town, and you will hardly fail
to be told of the Mengu Stone, regarded with some
veneration by its possessors because no one
knows anything about it." But is not that
precisely the reason why so many things are
venerated? There is something of the sublime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
in the mere vague importance of this stone, from
which proclamations and announcements of local
public events have from time immemorial been
made, and it is as important to St. Austell as the
famous stone of Destiny from Scone, now in the
Coronation Chair at Westminster Abbey; the
stone on which the ancient Scottish kings were,
and our own monarchs now are, crowned.</p>

<div class="caption">PORTHPEAN.</div>
</div>

<p>Returning to the coast, at Charlestown, Porthpean
is reached; apparently a small holiday-resort
of the burgesses of St. Austell. You see
from this sketch exactly what it is: a little sandy
bay with a few row-boats and sailing-vessels,
a few bathing-machines, and a refreshment-house
or two. More or less steep and obscure paths
lead from it round Black Head, and so down hill
into Pentewan, a very busy little port with railway-sidings
and docks, and vessels waiting cargoes
of tin-ore and china-clay.</p>

<p>Mevagissey, three miles or more, by Pennare
and the cliffs, is two staggeringly steep miles distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
by road, ending in a murderous crooked
descent. At the same time, it is all nonsense to
say that cycling is not possible in Cornwall.
Work, courage, and good, reliable brakes are
requisite, it is true; but although a good deal
of hard work and much walking uphill (and some
down) are necessary, cycling, after all, saves
effort, here as elsewhere. In the far from bracing
climate of Cornwall, the exertion of carrying
one's own body is often more tiring than even
pedalling hard uphill. Even on the shocking
coastwise bye-roads, apt often to be mere cascades
of loose stones, and full of sharp turns, it is often
better to have a cycle than to be without one.
Even so, letting the machine go down these dubious
ways, I murmur, as did the pious knights of old,
travelling the haunted valleys and the darkling
woods, '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">In manus tuas, Domine</i>,' and brave the unknown
perils that lurk behind hairpin corners and
down steep gradients.</p>

<p>Mevagissey is said to derive its name from
Saints Mewan and Issey, to whom its church is
dedicated. It is a little town as crowded together
as Polperro, but not by any means so picturesque.
Also it faces more directly upon the sea, and
although it offers no sands for the visitor and has
a very fishy, smelly little harbour, it has in many
ways been modernised. Take it for all in all,
Mevagissey looks its best from the sea. Perhaps
Mevagissey has been frightened into modern ways,
for it had an unexampled experience among
Cornish villages in 1849, when cholera was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
rampant that it was deserted until a thorough
cleansing was effected.</p>

<p>If we may trust a satirical saying of Fowey and
St. Austell, the Mevagissey people are not, or were
not used to be, given to acknowledging authority.
One man they considered to be as good as another,
and thus the old local by-word may yet be heard
in the district: "Like the Mevagissey volunteers;
all officers and no privates." But the
allusion is over a century old, and belongs to that
volunteering epoch when Napoleon was threatening
to invade England; so let us hope things have
altered since then.</p>

<p>There are sands of some small extent at Portmellin,
up out of Mevagissey and then steeply
down, half a mile distant, to where the land
begins to trend abruptly out towards Chapel
Point, and a few bungalows have, in consequence,
been lately built in what was until recently a
lonely hollow. Looking backwards for many
miles, the china-clay works on the distant hills
about St. Stephen-in-Brannel shine white, like
the glorious camp of some heavenly host.</p>

<p>Always steeply up, the road goes on to Gorran,
a mile inland, with Gorran Haven, a little crabbers'
and shrimpers' village, as a kind of seashore
annexe. The Dodman, a desolate headland, shuts
out everything to the westward and forms the
eastward horn of Veryan Bay. On its cliffs, of
three hundred feet and more, a coastguard station
looks out upon many empty leagues of troubled
waters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>St. Michael Caerhayes lies snugly in a little
bay within the greater bay of Veryan. The road,
curving a little way inland, out of sight of the
sea, descends steeply through overhanging trees
and suddenly emerges upon a level strand, where
the sea comes rolling in, over sands that afford
a foothold as unyielding as the floor of a room.
On either side of the inlet rise picturesque rocks,
those on the western side the bolder of the two,
and draped, moreover, with luxuriant vegetation,
and further crested with larch and pine. Whether
you look out to sea, or, standing on those yellow
sands, face inland, the scene is of the most
romantic description and worthy of the great
Skelt himself, of the famous "Skelt's Juvenile
Drama." Indeed, those massed and jagged rocks,
with darkling fissures, on whose summits the pine-trees
seem to cling desperately, might well have
served as models for the set scenes of Skelt's
thrilling stage, in "The Red Rover," or "The
Smuggler," or other of his melodramas. Out to
sea, in the "offing," ships hover; inland, under
the lee of the wooded rocks, rises a castle. The
place is instinct with drama, and it has a name of
the strangest&mdash;St. Michael Caerhayes&mdash;but it is
quiet enough for all that, and there is no village.</p>

<p>The castle looks sufficiently thrilling, and
might, with its surrounding fitly set the stage in
<em>Ruddigore</em>, but the inevitable guide-book spoils the
thrill it gives, by letting us into the secret of its
being built in 1808, when country mansions took
the form of "castles" only for "picturesque"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
reasons. No bad baronet resides there, only the
worthy commoner family of Williams; and any
one who is afraid of a person called Williams,
who lives in a sham castle, must be a poor creature,
even though the castellan does display
threatening notice-boards, setting forth what trespassers
may expect to suffer. St. Michael
Caerhayes was anciently the seat of the famous
Trevanion family, extinct a century or more ago,
and their old house demolished to make way for
the present building. There are many place-names
in Brittany parallel with those in Cornwall,
and St. Michael Carhaix is one of them. Not
only so, but a justification of Cornwall and of
the Breton "Cornouaille" calling cousins is
further shown by a singular occurrence which
happened during our wars with France towards
the close of the eighteenth century. Among the
French (or rather Bretons, for Brittany is not
France to a Breton, any more than Cornwall to
a Cornishman is England), among the Breton
prisoners, therefore, landed at Falmouth, was one
Jean Trevanion de Carhaix.</p>

<p>In Mevagissey the people talk strangely about
the seclusion sought for at St. Michael Caerhayes,
and tell weird tales of photographers and artists
prevented from taking views of this lovely spot.
So it was, perhaps, not altogether without trepidation
that the sketch for the accompanying illustration
was taken, from the seashore. No angry
Williams, no brutal bailiff, appeared; and so
perhaps the Mevagissey folk exaggerate. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
since then a report of the visit of an antiquarian
society to the dread castle itself has appeared,
by which it seems that the owner had not lured
the party into his stronghold with a view to casting
them into noisome dungeons, or having them
flung from the battlements, or anything else in
that full-flavoured way. He simply welcomed
them, as any civilised being would have done,
and the only outstanding feature of the day seems
to have been his remark that, except the collections
of different kinds in the house, there was
really nothing of antiquity left; not even the
stone sculptured with arms, of the time of Henry
the Eighth, which the guide-books declare to be
here, but is not.</p>

<p>The Church of St. Michael Caerhayes stands

a wan and sorry avenue of spindly sycamores,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
past the lodge-gates of the "castle"; and then
it is seen standing in a bald, exposed situation
beside the road. The last vestiges of the olden
Trevanions are seen in the church. An alien fowl
has nested on the site of their ancient home, but
still the church houses the rusty helmets of their
funeral armour, and a sword, said to be the identical
falchion wielded by Sir Hugh Trevanion at
Bosworth, August 21st, 1485, hangs among them.
The last Trevanions, whether pure-blooded, or
merely Bettesford-Trevanions, would seem, according
to the evidence of the monumental inscriptions
of a century or so ago, their natural force
abated, to have slid early and gratefully out of an
existence of pain and suffering.</p>

<p>But the most interesting object in the church,
interesting because of its mystery, is a black-painted,
life-sized statue, in Coade-ware, dated
1812, of a naval officer, with a real sword. The
singular thing is that, although the antiquity of
the thing is of the slightest, nobody knows who
is represented by it. It is thought to be one of
the Bettesford-Trevanions. Yet, although we
have lost count of this recent statue's identity,
the mummified Pharaohs of thousands of years
ago are identified with certainty.</p>

<p>Veryan, the village that gives a name to the
bay, does not lie upon the seashore. You come
to it round the majestically romantic cliffs past
Port Holland, a small fisher-hamlet perched upon
the rocky outlet of a quite solitary valley, and
thence a little way inland, and presently out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
again and very steeply and lengthily down, so
that you wonder when you will reach the bottom,
to Port Loe, a gloomy inlet amid dark overhanging
cliffs. Down there is the poor fishing village, in
a primitive state, absolutely untouched by pleasure-seekers,
and apparently not thriving in its
fishery. But its situation down there, below the
echoing cliffs reverberating to the mocking cries
of the sea gulls, is magnificent.</p>

<div class="caption">"PARSON TRUST'S HOUSES."</div>
</div>

<p>Veryan, on the other hand, is a picture of
inland prosperity. It is a long, scattered village,
beginning on a hill and continuing down through
a wooded valley, with the church at the bottom,
and ending on another hilltop. And at either
end, the road is flanked by two strange old
thatched round-houses, with a cross on the roof
of each. The local story is that they were built<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
by "Parson Trust," to keep the Devil out of the
village; but the identity of "Parson Trust"
has not been established. The simplicity which
not only believes in a personal Devil, but assumes
that he must of necessity come by road, is essentially
and delightfully Cornish.</p>

<p>The road out of Veryan leads directly to
Gerrans Bay, passing under the shoulder of the
strikingly sudden hill known as Carn Beacon. It
is a hill upon a hill, a sepulchral barrow heaped up
upon a height overlooking the sea; placed in this
commanding position by way of doing greater
honour to the ancient chieftain buried there.
This was, traditionally, the sixth-century Cornish
King and Saint, Geraint, or Gerennius, who died
in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 596, from whom the village and the bay of
Gerrans are named. He is not to be confused
with the Arthurian Geraint, who died in battle.
Tradition has been often proved true, but the
gorgeous story which told how the King had been
buried here, in a golden boat with silver oars, and
with his sword and crown, has been disproved,
flatly enough, for the barrow was opened in 1855,
and only a stone chest containing the ashes of
Geraint, or another, was found. "Sold again!"
as Smith Minor of the Lower Fourth might say.</p>

<p>The village of Gerrans calls for little remark.
It stands high, some distance back from the sea,
and therefore suffers considerably from the severe
competition of its offshoot, Portscatho, down below,
a thriving seaside place on Gerrans Bay.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smallfont">ROSELAND&mdash;ST. MAWES&mdash;FALMOUTH</span></h2>

<p>The great harbour of Falmouth and the many
creeks of the estuary of the Fal, running far
inland to Truro and Tresilian Bridge, rival the
Hamoaze and the estuary of the Tamar in size,
and more than rival them in beauty. Or perhaps,
instead of setting them in competition with one
another, it may be said that their beauty is of
different character. Along the shores of Hamoaze
and Tamar, the great commercial and naval and
warlike interests of Plymouth and Devonport
form striking features, and you can by no means
lose sight of them until Saltash is passed. In
Falmouth Harbour and along the broad estuary
of the Fal, past Carrick Roads and so on to
Malpas, towns, commerce, and shipping are only
incidental and remote. If you want Falmouth,
you must go seek it; if you would seek its smaller
brother, St. Mawes, on the hither side, you must
almost make diligent quest; and as for the villages
of St. Just-in-Roseland, Mylor, St. Feock,
Lamorran, Ruan Lanihorne, and others, why,
they are all tucked away in creeks, in a kind
of Robinson Crusoe reclusion. To say that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
creeks of Falmouth Harbour and the estuary of
the Fal resemble a hand with spreading fingers is
a ready and irresistible figure of speech, but it is
a hand with at least nine fingers, of very varying
size. They are St. Mawes, or Porthcueil Creek;
St. Just Creek; Ruan Creek; Tresilian Creek;
Truro River; Roundwood Creek; Restronguet
Creek, Mylor Creek, and Penryn Creek. It is
about nine miles, measured direct on the map,
from the entrance to Falmouth Harbour, between
Pendennis and St. Anthony's lighthouse, to Truro,
and a little longer to Tresilian Bridge, but the
course is anything but straight, and therein&mdash;in
the winding wooded shores, with inviting channels
opening out on either side&mdash;lies much of the
charm of these waterways.</p>

</div>

<p>The district on this, the eastern, side of Falmouth
Harbour, is Roseland, not by any means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
so named from roses, but rather from "rhos,"
meaning "moorland." It does not nowadays
seem a good description. You figure a moor as
a ghastly inhospitable upland, where it always
rains or snows, and where the bleak winds beat
upon the traveller on its unsheltered wilds. Now
the Cornish "Roseland" is, in fact, a good deal
nearer a land of roses than a terrible district of
savage moors; and although part of it is undoubtedly
high and exposed, it is not by any
means an unfertile spot, and it abounds in the
most delightful valleys, deep down, where the
last salt ripples of the creeks lap lazily to the
roots of oak-woods, and where the airs are warm
and steamy; where not merely roses will grow,
but sub-tropical plants flourish, and the fuchsia
and the geranium come to amazingly vigorous
developments. Such is Roseland.</p>

<p>St. Mawes, and Falmouth too, and indeed most
of the places beside these waters, wear a very
foreign look. The warm, languorous climate, inducing
luxuriant and exotic growths and unusual
ways of building, is largely responsible for this. St.
Mawes, too, is built up-along from the waterside,
on the face of a hill almost cliff-like. It owes its
name to an Irish saint, who is variously styled
St. Machutus, or Mauduit. He is the St. Malo
after whom the well-known port in Brittany is
christened. It is an ill-sounding name for a
saint, whether we call him "Mauduit" or "Malo,"
reminding one of the rhyme in Valpy's "Latin
Delectus":</p>

<img src="images/i_114.jpg" width="600" height="340" alt="" />
<div class="caption">ST. MAWES CASTLE.</div>
</div>

<p>St. Mawes Castle shares with Pendennis, on
the opposite headland, the duty of defending the
entrance to Falmouth Harbour from the open sea;
but the saints&mdash;St. Mawes and others&mdash;preserve
us from reliance upon such defenders! They may
have been formidable castles of the battery kind
when originally built by Henry the Eighth, who,
apart from his strange matrimonial experiments,
is a very much misunderstood monarch, but they
could not nowadays give an enemy the slightest
hesitation. All the same, elaborate pretences
are maintained, and Pendennis and St. Mawes are
girdled about with War Office prohibitions; just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
as though they were not shams that fail to deceive
any one.</p>

<p>Historians, too busy with the domestic affairs
of Henry the Eighth, and too interested in the
great religious cataclysm of his reign, do not
award him the title of "patriot king" that is
really his due. He was a mighty builder of
coastwise batteries against possible invasion;
not only ordaining the building of them, but
travelling much to see that they were built upon
the most effective situations. From the coast
of Kent to the Isles of Scilly his pot-bellied
batteries are to be found: formidable in their
day and still often occupied by details of Garrison
Artillery playing a great game of make-believe, in
which neither the foreigner nor the Englishman
has any faith. Latin inscriptions carved on the
exterior walls of St. Mawes Castle give Henry his
due, and, he at last being dead, piously hope
Edward the Sixth will resemble him. Here is
the English of them:</p>

<p>"Henry, thy honour and praises shall always
remain."</p>

<p>"May happy Cornwall now rejoice, Edward
being chief."</p>

<p>"May Edward be like his father in deeds and
reputation."</p>

<p>I think the person who composed that last
line and also the other person who cut it in the
stone must have smiled at it, just as every one has
done in all the three and a half centuries since.</p>

<p>Half-way across the entrance to the Harbour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
is the Black Rock, visible at low water, but covered
at the flood. It is the subject of a story which
tells how a Trefusis of Trefusis, not living on
altogether satisfactory terms with his wife, determined
to be rid of her in an ingenious way. "Shall
we, my dear," said he, "sail down the harbour
and land at Black Rock?" "Agreed," she replied,
unsuspecting; and so they proceeded to
the spot. He handed her ashore, and then
jumped again into the boat and made off, leaving
her, as he supposed, to drown. But unfortunately,
from his point of view, some fishermen later on
brought her off and home. The lady bade them
wait, and her husband would suitably reward
them. "To the Devil with you!" he exclaimed,
in a fury; "you have played me a sorry trick
indeed, and so you'll get nothing. You might
have earned gold by leaving her there!"</p>

<p>There is ample opportunity in crossing from
St. Mawes to Falmouth by steamer to perceive
the truth of Carew's remark, that a hundred sail
of vessels might anchor in Falmouth Harbour
and not one see the mast of another. In these
latter days this magnificent haven is not put to
much use, and Falmouth has since 1850 ceased
to be the West Indian mail-packet station. In
that year its long and honourable connection with
the Admiralty and the Post Office, which had
been continuous since 1688, ended in favour of
Southampton.</p>

<p>The town of Falmouth is seen hiding snugly
away at the opening of Penryn Creek, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
inner side of the low-lying isthmus connecting
the headland of Pendennis with the mainland.
It is not an ancient place, and did not, in fact,
come officially into existence until 1660, although
some few years earlier the custom-house had been
removed from Penryn and a market had been
established in 1652. On August 20th, 1660, a
proclamation was issued by the King, in answer
to a petition by Sir Peter Killigrew, commanding
that "Smithike, <em>alias</em> Penny-come-Quick, shall for
ever after this day be called, named, and known
by the name of Falmouth."</p>

<p>This was a great triumph for the Killigrew
family, who had for half a century been endeavouring
to found a town on this site, two miles
nearer the sea than the old corporate town and
port of Penryn. At that period the Killigrews
were seated at the mansion of Arwenack, of
which some few portions remain near Falmouth
railway-station, and they foresaw great profits
accruing to them on a town being built upon their
land. Penryn had been built in its more inland
situation at a remote period when, by reason of
raids and invasions, it was dangerous to be seated
near the sea, and the position of Arwenack was
certainly better for shipping. But the vested
interests of Penryn were endangered by the
Killigrew proposal, and Penryn, and Truro, and
Helston as well, long bitterly opposed it, foreseeing
much injury to themselves in a rival springing
up. The site of Falmouth was at that time
occupied only by two clusters of cottages that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
could scarce even be termed hamlets. They were
named Penny-come-Quick and Smithike, or
Smithick. The first of these places took its
singular name from the old Cornish "Pen-y-cwm,"
that is to say, "Head of the vale," to which the
Anglo-Saxon "wick"&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>, "village"&mdash;had afterwards
accrued. "Smithick" was probably the
site of a wayside smithy.</p>

<p>Falmouth town is practically one long, very
narrow, and not very clean waterside street of
closely packed houses and shops, which shut out
all except occasional glimpses of the beautiful
harbour, seen from a quay here and there, or
framed in by narrow alleys giving upon steps
going down to the water. There is much of the
nautical Dibdin and Wapping Old Stairs feeling
about this long, long street of Market Strand,
with the strong sea air blowing in upon the
otherwise stuffy thoroughfare through these dark-browed
openings. Suggestions, too, of old smuggling
days are found in queer sail-lofts overhanging
the water; suggestions not without
plentiful warranty in old records, for we know
that smuggling proceeded impudently and openly
at Falmouth in the last quarter of the eighteenth
century. The sheer matter-of-course of it raises
a smile. Men spoke of being&mdash;as of in the army
or the navy&mdash;in the smuggling "service"; which
at once shows how widespread and highly
organised the operations were. Captain Pellew,
brother of Lord Exmouth, sent to Falmouth to
put down smuggling, actually found some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
his own officers running contraband cargoes of
wine, in open port and in broad daylight.</p>

<p>As you go seaward, past the railway station,
the almost island promontory of Pendennis rises
up, and stretches a much greater distance out to
sea than the explorer who seeks to round the
point at first supposes. A fine, broad carriage-road
describes a loop round this headland. "Pendinas,"
"the headland castle"&mdash;for that was the
original form of the name&mdash;has been, as the
name itself implies, from the earliest times a
place of defence, but the only known event of
any moment that is remembered in connection
with it is the stand here made for the King by
Sir John Arundell of Trerice, then in his eighty-seventh
year, and known in all these parts as
"Jack-for-the-King." It was one of the most
memorable deeds done in those troublous, long-drawn
contentions between King and Parliament.
With the exception of Raglan Castle, in Monmouthshire,
which held out to the last for King
Charles, and only surrendered on August 19th,
1646, Pendennis Castle was the last stronghold
to fly the Royal Standard. It capitulated on
August 16th, only three days earlier, after a
vigorous six months' siege, and when hunger,
rather than any quality of the enemy, had brought
the garrison low. Hence the Queen had embarked
for France two years earlier, and the Prince of
Wales departed for Scilly in February 1646.</p>

<p>The stranger is more likely to be impressed
by the ugly lines of sharp-pointed pike railings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
that surround the precincts of Pendennis Castle,
and have been richly tarred, lest by any chance
the spikes are not sufficiently formidable, than
by any appearance either of strength or picturesqueness
that belongs to the place. The military
genius that finds a first line of defence in the
messy horrors of tar, seems something not much
better than the old practice in the Chinese Army,
of making horrible grimaces, wherewith to strike
terror into the enemy.</p>

<p>You see, on returning to Falmouth from
Pendennis, how entirely land-locked the harbour
appears to be. Not the slightest indication
points to which way the Channel lies. Yet this
enclosed water has been ruffled by great and
disastrous storms, and in one of them, off Trefusis
Point, directly opposite the town, the transport
<em>Queen</em> was lost, in January 1814.</p>

<p>The climate of Falmouth is tearful. I may
be unlucky in the matter of weather here, but
I have never yet been at Falmouth when it did
not rain. But it is also phenomenally warm.
St. Gluvias, by Penryn, is said to be the warmest
place in England. The Sailors' Home, on the
quay by Arwenack, gives earnest of these warm
conditions. It is a great, grim, eighteenth-century
mansion of red brick, but made beautiful, almost
transfigured indeed, by a wonderful fuchsia,
covering the whole of the frontage up to the
first-floor windows.</p>

<p>In the humblest cottage-gardens grows the
fuchsia. It flourishes even in the merest cobble-stoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
backyards, enclosed within white-washed
walls, and neighboured by the washing-stool and
tub, and the clothes hung out to dry; and it is
amidst such apparently unsuitable surroundings,
rather than in the most carefully tended gardens,
that this gorgeous alien seems most to prosper.
For the fuchsia is an alien, brought into Europe
in 1703, from the Pacific coast of South America,
and named after an old-time German botanist of
the sixteenth century; one Leonard Fuchs. All
through the West of England the fuchsia has
become&mdash;not common; we must not use that
word, lest by any chance we should seem to
slight so exquisite a plant&mdash;but usual, and
especially it flourishes along the coasts, and
thrives so greatly that it grows in the open all
the year round, and frequently attains such
dimensions that the stems of old-established
plants are not uncommonly nearly as thick as a
man's arm.</p>

<p>Yet in 1788 there was but one fuchsia in
England, and that was in Kew Gardens. Soon
after that date an enterprising nurseryman of
Hammersmith, one Lee by name, had secured
cuttings, and was selling plants at one guinea
each. Thenceforward the spread of the fuchsia
was rapid.</p>

<p>The variety seen in Devon and Cornwall is
nearly always that with abundance of small
blossoms: scarlet petals, and blue or purple sepals.</p>

<p>The parish church of Falmouth is almost
the oldest building in the town, but it is hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
venerable. It is galleried within and hangs
gloomily upon the narrow street, squalidly mingled
with a cab-rank. It was built in 1663, and has
the peculiarity of being dedicated to Charles the
First, King and Martyr; a distinction it shares
with three other churches in England and one
in Wales; <em>i.e.</em> those of Tunbridge Wells, Charles
Church, Plymouth, Peak Forest, Derbyshire, and
Newtown, Montgomeryshire. A further peculiarity
is that its tower is not square on plan.</p>

<div id="Fig_i_122" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption">CHARLES CHURCH.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>There are many other public buildings in
the town, none of much interest; but it is interesting
to know that there was once a Mayor of
Falmouth who thanked God when the gaol was
enlarged. He, or his remark, is quite famous,
but I have no record of the period in which this
worthy, so thanksgiving for benefits received,
flourished. There is, however, no doubt at all
that, if it was in the sixteenth century, when
such doings as those of the piratical Lady Killigrew
(of whom we shall hear at Penryn) were
possible, not only the enlargement of a gaol was
required, but a special assize as well.</p>

<p>I believe the most interesting place in Falmouth
is, after all, not the famous harbour,
nor Pendennis Castle, but Burton's Old Curiosity
Shop. It is a quite famous institution, and
no one who has ever been to Falmouth, and has
not explored this home of curios, can really be
said to know Falmouth as intimately as he
should. This sounds like an advertisement, but
Burton's is as superior to puffery as a museum
would be; and indeed it is not remotely unlike
a museum. True, the exhibits are for sale, but
such a large proportion are so eminently undesirable
for the private purchaser that they
assume the character of museum exhibits unlikely
ever to find another home. Such, for example,
is the skeleton of a whale washed up some years
ago between Cadgwith and Porthoustock. The
imagination boggles at any private person buying
that. It would seem, indeed, that Burton (who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
is now deceased, and his son reigns in his stead)
had a <em>flair</em> for curiosities and antiques of all
kinds, quite irrespective of commerce. He could
resist nothing, and was a fine miscellaneous
feeder in this sort. But at the same time an
excellent man of business, keen on odd and
striking advertisement; as when he offered to
purchase for £500 Smeaton's old Eddystone
lighthouse tower, demolished by the Trinity
House in 1882. He proposed to re-erect it on
the site of his shop and store it with his curios,
but the old tower found a home on Plymouth
Hoe instead. One may visit the Old Curiosity
Shop and wander at will, unattended, through
its many rooms, and never be solicited to buy;
and great is the number of those who use this
privilege.</p>

<p>Among the oddest of these collections is a
strange assemblage of inn and trade signboards,
mostly of Cornish origin, most of them so fantastically
grotesque in spelling and unconsciously
humorous in phrasing, that they would almost
appear to be inventions, produced to astonish
and to raise a laugh, were it not that they are
obviously old, and that the proprietor keeps a
register of their place of origin. Thus runs the
signboard of Ellen Tone's "Tempurence Hottell,"
from Herodsfoot, near Liskeard:</p>

CREEK AND THE SURRENDER OF
THE CORNISH ARMY.</span></h2>

<p>Flushing, a little over-the-water town opposite
Falmouth, shares with the neighbouring St.
Gluvias the reputation of being the warmest place
in England. It is said to have been founded by
Dutchmen, from Flushing in Holland. Near by
it is the hamlet curiously known as Little Falmouth;
a place with a few waterside houses and
remains of a granite-built dock, commanding
views down to Falmouth and Pendennis, which
looks like an island from here. Little Falmouth,
with its decaying dock, forms a picturesque scene
of blighted hopes.</p>

<p>The old town of Penryn, at the head of Penryn
Creek, is even more dirty than Falmouth, and
does not look prosperous. Falmouth, as Penryn
surely foresaw, has filched away much of the
trade, and although the shipping of granite from
the neighbouring quarries of Mabe and Constantine
gives employment still, it is not an increasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
business. The parish church is quite
apart from the town, in the village of St. Gluvias.
The saint of that name appears to have been a
Welshman. He spelt his name "Glywys," a
fearful mouthful for a Saxon to deal with, and
apparently not easy even for a Cornishman,
seeing that Cornwall has modified the name.
Glywys was brother to St. Cadoc, or Cadwg, and
I have no doubt called cousins with half a hundred
others.</p>

</div>

<p>Penryn is closely associated with two Lady
Killigrews, who are generally confused almost
inextricably with one another. The Killigrew
family of Arwenack, where Falmouth town now
stands, had striven from about 1602 for a new
town and market to be planted there, and thus
earned the undying hatred of Penryn; and so it
happened that when Sir John Killigrew and his
wife quarrelled and fought, he for divorce and she
against it, about 1620, it seemed the most natural
thing in the world for her to take refuge in Penryn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and there, encouraged by the bad blood of the
place, to protract ruinous litigation with her
husband. All the evidence seems to show that
she was as bad a character as possible, even though
she came of an old landed family, the Fermors,
afterwards Barons Lempster and Earls of Pomfret.
This Lady Jane Killigrew was at last
divorced, but the unhappy Sir John did not long
survive his victory, and his unamiable wife thereupon
presented to the Corporation of Penryn the
tall silver Killigrew Cup still in existence, inscribed:
"1633 From Maior to Maior to the towne of
Permarin, where they received mee that was in
great misery, Jane Killygrew."</p>

<p>The earlier Lady Killigrew was Mary, wife of
another Sir John, grandfather of the unhappy
man just mentioned. It was in January 1583
that the Spanish ship <em>Maria</em>, upon which she
exercised her piratical genius, sailed into Falmouth
Harbour and cast anchor. The crew
remained on board, but the two merchants who
owned her cargo went to a Penryn inn. Lady
Killigrew seems to have entirely originated the
scheme of piracy and murder that was carried
through. She procured a boatload of fishermen,
sworn to secrecy, who at midnight swarmed
aboard and murdered some of the Spaniards, and
flung others into the sea. They then took the
vessel to Ireland. The spoils of the Spanish ship
consisted of holland-cloth and leather, together
with two hogsheads of Spanish pieces of eight.
It had been intended to cajole the two merchants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
aboard, on some pretext, and so to murder all
concerned with the vessel, but they remained
ashore. Not even in those times was it possible
to commit piracy and murder in home waters
altogether with impunity; and by some means the
owners heard of what had really happened, and
sought redress of the Government. In the end,
Lady Killigrew and two of her fellow-conspirators
were found guilty and sentenced to death. Unfortunately,
the influence brought to bear on
behalf of Lady Killigrew procured her a pardon.
The others, not being persons of quality, were
hanged in an expeditious and workmanlike manner.</p>

<p>Round Trefusis Point opens Mylor Creek, a
mile and a half long, with Mylor village appearing
at the opening and the much larger village of
Mylor Bridge at its inland extremity. Mylor is a
favourite place for afternoon excursions from
Falmouth, and there are farmhouse tea-gardens
amid much charming woodland scenery.</p>

<p>St. Melor, to whom the church is dedicated,
and after whom the village of Mylor is in turn
named, was traditionally martyred here. Other
legends, however, place the scene of his death in
Brittany. He was son of Melian, King of Cornu-Gallia,
or Brittany, in the sixth century. Melian
himself is said to have been killed in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 537, by
his brother, Rivold, and is regarded as something
of a saint in Brittany. The village of Guimiliau
enshrines his name.</p>

<p>Rivold then, having ended King Melian, mutilated
his son, Melor, by cutting off his right hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and left foot; the object being to invalidate him
from the succession to the throne, the Armorican
laws forbidding any who suffered from physical
disabilities from becoming King. The affectionate
servants of Melor, however, provided him with
a silver hand and a brazen foot, which became
miraculously endowed with the powers and attributes
of his lost natural members. Melor, sent to
the monastery of Saint Corantine, became so saintly
and therefore so dangerous to the usurper Rivold,
that his death was resolved upon. One Cerialtan,
a man-of-all-work in crime, was commissioned to
end him; his promised reward being "as much
land as he could see from the summit of Mount
Coc"&mdash;wherever that may be. Cerialtan, in
workmanlike manner, cut off Melor's head as he
lay asleep, and conveyed it to Rivold, who carried
out his compact to the letter, if not to the spirit;
for he caused Cerialtan's eyes to be put out, and
then had him to the crest of that high place and
bade him look upon the land!</p>

<p>And that is all I know about the Life and
Times of St. Melor; or at any rate, that is the
most likely among the different marvellous stories
from which the investigator is at liberty to choose.
But legendary vagueness pervades all of them,
and there is the very wide choice of dates
between <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 411 and 537 for the speculative to
select from.</p>

<p>Mylor church lies in a hollow, a favourite
situation for churches in Cornwall. Although
now chiefly in the Perpendicular style, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
portions of a former Norman church, which must
have been a building of considerable richness and
beauty, remain, including three Norman doorways,
all of unusual design. The hood-moulding
of that on the north side represents a snake, with
its head to the west. The south doorway,
illustrated here, has, it will be observed, some
curiously Flamboyant tracery added to the round
arch, with an odd variety of Perpendicular
panelling at the sides. The identical pattern,
peculiar to Cornwall, is found in a similar position
on the south porch at Lelant, near St. Ives.</p>

<div class="caption">SOUTH PORCH AND CROSS, MYLOR CHURCH.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>A monument in the church recalls a dramatic
and terrible shipwreck that happened scarce two
miles away, off Trefusis Point, in Falmouth Harbour.
The epitaph briefly refers to it as under:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To the memory of the warriors, women, and children
who, on their return to England from the coast
of Spain, unhappily perished in the wreck of the
<em>Queen</em> transport, on Trefusis Point, January 14th,
1814."</p></blockquote>

<p>Three hundred lives were lost on that occasion,
and one hundred and thirty-six of the drowned
were buried here.</p>

<p>To Mylor belongs the distinction of possessing
the tallest cross in Cornwall. Exactly what it is
like you may see from the illustration. It does
not actually look the tallest, because some seven
feet of its length are embedded in the ground. It
measures in all 17 feet 6 inches. No one until
1870 knew it to be a cross at all, for beyond the
memory of man it had fulfilled the useful office
of buttress to the south wall of the church, with
its head covered up. In that year, during the
restoration then in progress, its nature was disclosed.
It was, however, a matter of considerable
difficulty to raise so large a block of granite again
upright, and help was obtained from H.M.S.
<em>Ganges</em>, then lying in Falmouth Harbour.</p>

<p>The pastime of curious epitaph-hunting, which
helps to occupy the time of many explorers in
the country, may be indulged in at Mylor with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
certain prospect of reward. Here is a taste of
their quality:</p>

<p class="center">
"In<br />
memory of m<sup>r</sup>.<br />

His End war Allmost Sudden<br />

his Foot it Slip And he did fall<br />

</p>

<p>Opposite Mylor Creek, on the eastern side of
the harbour, is the creek of St. Just-in-Roseland,
with St. Just's church down by the waterside,
among the trees.</p>

<p>The parson of St. Just-in-Roseland must surely
be a kindly man. Instead of threatening or rebuking
the numerous visitors from Falmouth, who
come down the creek in boats and land to explore
the place, and have doubtless in the past pillaged
the ferns and other things growing in the beautiful
churchyard, he displays the following notice in the
lych-gate: "Visitors are requested not to touch
anything in the churchyard, and then, by calling
at the rectory, all those from beyond the county
of Cornwall will be welcome to a gift plant or
tree, as a souvenir of their visit to St. Just-in-Roseland."</p>

<p>In the great roomy church, which must always
have been, as it is now, many times larger than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the needs of the place, there may be noticed a
tablet which describes how John Randall, for
one thousand years from his death in 1733, has
"given to ye poor Widows and fatherless children
of ye parish, not having parish pay, Twenty Shillings
yearly, and Ten Shillings yearly to ye
Minister, for preaching a Funeral Sermon."</p>

</div>

<p>The next creek on the western side of the
harbour is that of Restronguet, a name which
appears to mean "deep channel." Dense woods
line its banks, with the park of Carclew half-way
along, upon the left hand, and on the right the
modern port of Devoran, carved out of the parish
of St. Feock in 1873, with the Penpoll Tin Smelting
Works fuming away, a mile below. Devoran is
at the terminus of a mineral railway from Redruth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
which thus brings tin and copper-ore to
deep-water quays. Restronguet Creek will, however,
need dredging, for the mine-water, charged
with mud, flowing down from the pits about
Gwennap, is shoaling the fairway, and has almost
choked the forked endings of the creek at Perran
Wharf. This is the waterside extension of Perranwell
and Perranarworthal, <em>i.e.</em> "Piran the Wonderful";
the really wonderful St. Piran, who voyaged
from Ireland to the north coast of Cornwall on a
millstone. The grass that grows in the mud-choked
creek stretching towards Ponsanooth is
in some way affected by the sea-water in the
ooze, turning it to the loveliest yellowish-green
imaginable.</p>

<p>Round Restronguet Point the channel comes to
St. Feock, a tiny village on a little creek of its
own. The church here has a detached belfry,
standing beside the road, at a higher level than
the body of the building; and over the lych-gate
entrance to the churchyard is an old vestry or
parish-room. A similar building is seen at the
entrance to the churchyard of Kenwyn, north
of Truro.</p>

<p>The most exquisitely wooded reaches of the
Fal are found above St. Feock, where the river
narrows and the banks rise more abruptly. The
scenery at this point, and on to Malpas and
Truro, strongly resembles that of the river Dart,
and many are of opinion that it is really superior.
But these comparisons form the thorniest of
subjects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>At the hamlet of Trelissick is the well-known
ferry of "King Harry Passage," now a steam-ferry
conveying vehicles as well as pedestrians. The
"King Harry" whose name gives the passage a
touch of romance, is Henry the Eighth, who is
said to have stayed a night at Trelissick, when on
his way to inspect the site of Pendennis Castle.</p>

</div>

<p>The woods of Tregothnan, the wide-spreading
park belonging to Lord Falmouth, come now into
view, where Ruan Creek opens on the right,
running three miles in an easterly direction. The
creek takes its name from the village of Ruan
Lanihorne, at the furthest extremity, where the
waters of the Fal run white with the washings
from upland clay-workings, like a river of milk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and the mud resembles cream-cheese. Midway
is Lamorran, the detached tower of its church
washed by another branching creek.</p>

<img src="images/i_138.jpg" width="600" height="278" alt="" />
<div class="caption">MALPAS.</div>
</div>

<p>Returning to the main stream, Malpas is
reached in another mile and a half, past Tregothnan
and the hillside church of St. Michael
Penkevil on the right, and the ruins of Old Kea
church on the left. St. Michael's churches are
generally on heights. This is on the Headland of
the Horse; for that is what "Penkevil" means.
Just as the Cornish word "eglos," for church,
closely resembles the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">église</i>, so it will here
be noted how nearly like the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cheval</i> is the
Cornish "kevil," for horse. In the restored
church are monuments to Lord Falmouth's ancestors,
notably to the famous Admiral Boscawen.
The St. Kea who gave his name to Kea church
was a fifth-century Irishman who lived awhile in
Wales, in Cornwall, and in Brittany.</p>

<p>Malpas is said to mean "smooth passage,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
although the word certainly seems to be a corruption
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">malus passus</i>, a bad passage. It is
locally "Mopus." But whether a good or ill
ferry, it is certainly a very beautiful spot.</p>

</div>

<p>Tresilian Creek, the ultimate extension of
these waters, here branches off to the right, with
the waterside village of St. Clements round the
first bend, its rustic cottages and church embowered
amid tall trees. There is a charming
little corner, illustrated here, behind the old
church, whose weathered age, and the bull's head
and other symbols of the four evangelists, that
look curiously down from the angles of the tower,
demand to be put upon record. A very tall Cornish
cross, of the fifth or sixth century, stands at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
back entrance to the vicarage, with an abbreviated
inscription in large letters running up the
shaft. It has been expanded into <span class="smcap">ISNIOCVS

<div class="caption">MERTHER.</div>
</div>

<p>Higher up the creek, a little distance inland
on the right, is the odd-looking little church of
Merther, quite solitary except for one woodman's
cottage. It is dedicated to St. Cohan, or Coanus,
and owes most of its strangeness to the wooden,
box-like finish to its tower: giving the effect of
a sanctified pigeon-house. A little statue of St.
Cohan, brought from his desecrated Holy Well,
is within. The church is not now used for services,
and is only retained as a mortuary chapel.
"Merther" signifies "martyr," but history, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
even tradition, are silent on the reason for conferring
the name.</p>

<p>Tresilian Creek (the name "Tresilian" means
"the place of eels") ends at Tresilian Bridge,
spanning the dusty highway between Grampound
and Truro. Here is the battlemented gateway
to the park of Tregothnan.</p>

<div class="caption">VIEW FROM TRESILIAN BRIDGE.</div>
</div>

<p>The quiet pastoral scenery, and the elms and
other trees here fringing the river, present a picture
very little like Cornwall.</p>

<p>The bridge is modern, but the spot is historic;
for this is that Tresilian Bridge where the long
contest in the Civil War in the West was brought
to a conclusion by the surrender of the Royalist
Cornish army under Lord Hopton, to Fairfax,
March 14th, 1646. It was an inglorious end to a
struggle that had opened so brilliantly for the King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
at Stratton, when Grenville and Hopton smote
the Parliament men hip and thigh, close upon
three years earlier; but time told continuously
against the King, whose troops grew more and
more undisciplined and dispirited, while the
earlier raw levies of the Parliament had become
the famous Ironsides, who knew little of defeat.</p>

<p>The final advance of Fairfax, commanding the
forces of the Parliament, into Cornwall was swift
and certain. He was at Exeter on February 8th;
at Chulmleigh on the 14th; and took Torrington
by storm on the 16th, when he got Hopton's men
on the run. Thence he advanced and entered
Launceston on the 25th, and had come to Bodmin
Downs by March 3rd, Hopton's force retreating
and dissolving before him. The Prince of Wales,
who hitherto had lain at Truro, found it prudent
to change his residence to Pendennis Castle,
Falmouth, and soon afterwards sailed for Scilly.
Hopton at last saw the hopelessness of further
resistance, and, after treating with Fairfax from
March 8th, surrendered here, on terms, on the
14th. The terms were mildness itself: officers
and private soldiers being allowed to depart to
their homes on taking an oath not to fight again
against the Parliament; and the officers were, in
addition, permitted to keep their arms and horses.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smallfont">TRURO</span></h2>

<p>Truro River runs straight up for two miles
from Malpas, the cathedral of Truro rising up
from the valley ahead, and shining white amid
a setting of green trees and blue distant hills
like some unearthly building too beautiful to have
been built by man. Very little else is seen of
Truro until quite close to the quays, where the
navigation ends, and it is something of a surprise
to find the city a place large enough to number
11,562 inhabitants. That is a small population,
but it is large compared with the expectations
raised by distant views.</p>

<p>The name of Truro is said to derive from
<i lang="kw" xml:lang="kw">Tru-Ru</i>, the "three streets," or roads; but there
are four roads into Truro, and its streets are many
more than three. Bodmin is the county town of
Cornwall, and Launceston rivals it, but Truro
has of late years risen into equal, if not greater,
importance, on account of its population, double
that of Bodmin, and by reason also of its more
accessible situation. Bodmin still keeps its assize
business, and the county gaol is situated there,
giving a certain sinister significance to the information
"he's gone to Bodmin"; but Truro, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
capital city of a newly constituted diocese, has
a greater future, unless the Cornish folk become
much more criminal than they are now, which is
not expected of them.</p>

<div id="Fig_i_144" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_144.jpg" width="600" height="304" alt="" />
<div class="caption">TRURO, FROM THE FAL.</div>
</div>

<p>Truro lies down in a valley and the Great
Western Railway stalks across to the north of it
on gigantic viaducts, the newer streets running
up towards the railway station. It is a clean,
granite-built place, with a well-defined aristocratic
air, and down the gutters of its principal
streets, which are chiefly paved with granite setts
and would thus be very noisy if there were more
traffic, run clear streams of water. As an old
county centre, the chief place of meeting for the
landed and leisured families of Cornwall in the old
days before railways, when Truro had a "season,"
and the society of Cornwall came hither to their
"town houses" to indulge in its gaieties, the
aristocratic air it keeps is by no means accidental.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
The "Red Lion" Hotel in the Market Place was
formerly one of these mansions, as its fine old
unaltered front shows. Foote, the actor, was
born there.</p>

<p>Truro was raised to the dignity of a cathedral
city in 1877, when the new Cornish diocese was
established, and the old parish church of St. Mary
in High Cross became automatically the Cathedral.
But the patriotic Cornish feeling which had thus
at last again brought about a bishopric and a
cathedral in the West, about eight hundred years
after the see had been removed from St. Germans
to Exeter, was not content with making a mere
parish church serve the occasion, and steps were
soon taken to build an entirely new cathedral.
Such a thing as the building of a cathedral in
England had not been known for many centuries;
the full efforts of churchmen had been employed,
ever since the Reformation, in preserving and
repairing those we already possessed, not in
creating new cathedrals. Moreover, most of our
cathedrals have been the products of centuries of
growth. Even that of Salisbury, the one example
of an ancient cathedral finished according to its
original design, was not completed in less than a
hundred and forty years. Over £100,000 has
gone to the building of Truro Cathedral, begun
in the laying of the foundation-stone by the
Prince of Wales on May 20th, 1880, and completed
in the autumn of 1909, in the finishing
touches then put to the western towers.</p>

<p>The old church of St. Mary was demolished to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
provide the site, but the fine Late Perpendicular
south aisle was spared and incorporated with the
building, designed in the Early English style by
J. L. Pearson, that forms the cathedral to-day.</p>

<p>High Cross, in which the cathedral stands,
is not a very roomy square of houses and shops
opening out of the Market Place in the centre
of the city, by a narrow passage, and upon other
streets by somewhat broader ways. But it is
along this passage that the stranger usually
approaches. The cathedral is indeed new, but the
old-established cramped surroundings are quite
characteristic of ancient cathedral cities, and the
calculated picturesqueness of the south side of
the building, viewed from this point, resembles
that of some North German cathedral. There
the central tower and its stone spire, and the
lesser western towers and spires group richly
together, with the still smaller but very prominent
south transept tower and its copper spirelet, a
very German importation. The poisonous oxidised
green of that copper spirelet is flagrant
enough to spoil the whole day of an artist. Down
beneath it you see the surviving sixteenth century
aisle of old St. Mary's. I am glad they spared that
aisle, for it is not only beautiful in itself, but its
venerable presence here serves to illustrate that
peculiarly English virtue, a continuity with the
past, a sense of history even in things new. But
what will future generations say about a late
nineteenth-century cathedral whose general style
is that of the thirteenth century, and yet whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
oldest part is genuine sixteenth-century architecture?
It could, perhaps, be wished that the
chimes of the cathedral clock had been harmonised
to another tune than the hackneyed
"Westminster Chimes," that are noble enough in
the clock-tower of the Houses of Parliament,
where they originated, but are tiresome when
repeated all over the country. The ancient
proverb is sadly at fault, for it <em>is</em> possible to have
too much of a good thing.</p>

<p>The new beauty of Truro Cathedral at present
lacks those weatherings that only time can give.
The fine-grained granite and the Box stone
dressings have not attained the stains and bloom
of years, and so it is impossible to altogether
judge the merits or drawbacks of the exterior;
but that the architect strove to be pictorial, and
that he rather overstrained in that direction, seems
undeniable. The building, only three hundred
feet in its greatest length, from east to west, is
really one of our smallest cathedrals, six feet
shorter than Rochester, and it is ornamented to
a degree that in places spoils the effect. This is
very noticeable in the south door, the usual
entrance. It is contrived in the south transept
and is loaded with ornamentation that emphasises
the naturally squeezed-in appearance. The
over-enrichment was a mistake, but the cramped
nature of this part seems to have been unavoidable,
considering the extreme narrowness of the
site here.</p>

<p>The interior discloses none of these limitations,
and exhibits a noble clerestoried nave of nine
bays and of fine proportions. A very notable
feature is the beautiful baptistery close by the
south door. Its many slender columns and the
artfully arranged half-light set off the rich stained-glass
with the effect of jewels. The choir is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>

the nave. Most of the windows are already
furnished with stained-glass, whose subjects include
a representation of Wesley preaching at
Gwennap: a more liberal-minded inclusion than
any of which Hawker of Morwenstow would have
been capable, with his bitter remark that Wesley
had made the Cornish <em>change</em> their sins; not get
rid of them, you know.</p>

<p>A certain specious air of antiquity is given
to the north transept by the old monuments from
St. Mary's, restored and built into the walls.
Notable among them is the Robartes monument
of 1614. And history is being quickly made here,
for already Truro has come to its third bishop
and the cathedral is beginning to accumulate
relics. Thus we see in a case on the east wall of
the south transept the pastoral staff presented
to Dr. Benson, the first Bishop.</p>

<p>There are also war memorials in the cathedral:
tablets and flags that tell eloquently of the latest
great effort in the art of murder by wholesale.
It is a bitter commentary upon Christianity that in
twenty years from the beginning of the cathedral
such things should be necessary. But the fault
was not ours, and no patriotic Englishman would
have those memorials away, for they show that
we can still hold our own against attack. "The
men are splendid," as a famous dispatch from
those sun-scorched fields ran. Of their officers it
were kinder to keep silence, but perhaps their
failure was merely the fault of the system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>There is an interesting museum of the Royal Institution
of Cornwall in Truro, with illustrations of
South American scenes a good deal too prominent
on its walls; and there is a curious old inscription
carved in granite on a wall in the Market House.
It belonged to an older building, and runs thus:
"Ienkin Daniel, Maior. Who seks to find
eternal tresvre, mvst vse no gvile in waight or
measvre, 1615."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smallfont">MAWNAN&mdash;HELFORD RIVER&mdash;MAWGAN-IN-MENEAGE&mdash;MANACCAN&mdash;ST.
ANTHONY IN ROSELAND&mdash;THE
MANACLES ROCKS&mdash;WRECK OF THE
"MOHEGAN"&mdash;ST. KEVERNE.</span></h2>

<p>Resuming the coast from Falmouth and leaving
that town by Swanpool, an easy woodland road
leads past the little sandy bay of Maen Porth
and, avoiding Rosemullion Head, comes to the
hamlet of Mawnan Smith, whence most travellers
go direct down to the crossing of the Helford
River at Durgan. But the church and the
original village of Mawnan, such as it is, lie
straight ahead.</p>

<p>The church of Mawnan is far remote from
the ordinary tourist track. Very few are those
who, exploring the rugged and greatly indented
coasts of Cornwall, endure to the end and do not
presently take some of the distant headlands
and the obscure nooks and corners on trust; and
Mawnan stands above a remote little Land's
End of its own that overlooks the otherwise
solitary mouth of the salt estuary called the
Helford River. You come past a few houses
and then, through a farmyard, to the church.</p>

<p>The inquisitive tourist may be recommended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
to visit that church, not that it possesses anything
above the average of architectural interest in
Cornwall, but because it is a prime example of
what is done in the High Church way in the
nooks and corners. Obviously it is ardently
desired to put back the clock of progress at
Mawnan, for the interior of the church is lavishly
decorated with texts and admonitions in the
old Cornish language, which became extinct so
long ago that nobody outside the ranks of scholars
has the least recollection of it; and it is quite
certain that the villagers of Mawnan do not
understand it, any more than they would Coptic
or Chaldee. So when they read on these walls,
among other things, "Da thym ythgu nesse the
Thu," they are obliged to take on trust the
translations of this phrase and others, that are
thoughtfully provided on cards. This particular
example means, it would appear, "Good it is
to me to draw near to God"; to which one
might offer the criticism, that the way would
probably be rendered easier by the adoption of
a language more readily understanded of the
people. No one, however, would be in the least
likely to criticise these things if they were done
only out of arch&aelig;ological zeal; but they are
evidences of obscurantism, and, taken with other
things, eloquent of an attempt to recover a
lost priestly domination. The other evidences are
not lacking; notably among them the notices
displayed of some precious "Society of King
Charles the Martyr," among which it is sought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
to restore the old "Office for January 30th,"
introduced by Bishop Duppa of Winchester at
the Restoration in 1661; an Office long ago
removed from the Prayer Book, which is so
much the better by the loss of it. There is not
so much to complain of in the passage that runs,
"Preserve from sacrilegious invasions those temporal
blessings which Thy Providence hath
bestowed on Thy Church"; for, put in other
words, this is nowadays a prayer against Disestablishment
and Disendowment; and we have
all of us the right of praying for our continued
existence. But few will be found to defend the
supplication, "Give us grace by a careful and
studious imitation of this Thy blessed Saint and
Martyr," meaning thereby Charles the First.
There are few who are not sentimentally sorry
for that unhappy King, born to trouble, and
earning more by his own actions; and we hate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Cromwell and his men. But those must be
very few indeed who are prepared to regard
Charles as a Saint and a Martyr, and when any
attempt is made to make him one we forget
our sympathies for a cultured and good-living
King, unfortunate enough to be born into distracted
times and to be born without tact, and
unequipped with the sense of keeping faith with
his opponents; and we say that Charles was
absolutely untrustworthy and a danger to the
nation, and that he deserved his fate.</p>

<div class="caption">THE HELFORD RIVER.</div>
</div>

<p>The Helford River is a miniature Falmouth
Harbour, with subsidiary creeks. It is about
six miles long and from half a mile to a quarter
of a mile wide, and is frequented only by a few
small yachts and sailing-boats. Above the passage-house
at Durgan comes the singularly retired
hamlet of Port Navas, in a small creek, with a
few thatched cottages smothered in roses and
jessamines. Yet the place is not so retired and
remote from the sophisticated world but that
one of the cottages boldly displays the notice
"Afternoon Teas"; not merely "teas" that
are meals, but "afternoon teas" that are, in
London at any rate, understood to be, not so
much teas taken in the afternoon (and when
else should they be taken?), as a sparing cup
and an insufficient cake, in conjunction with a
great deal of more or less scandalous small-talk:</p>

<p>Polwheverill Creek runs up on the right to
the granite-quarrying village of Constantine, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the main Helford River continues past the
oyster-beds of Merthen to the hamlet of Gweek,
where its farthest point is reached.</p>

<div class="caption">MAWGAN-IN-MENEAGE.</div>
</div>

<p>Returning round its southern shores, Mawgan-in-Meneage
stands amid great swelling green
hills, wooded in rich parklike manner, at the
head of a tiny inlet. The St. Mawgan who has
given his name to this place, and to Mawgan-in-Pydar,
on the north coast of Cornwall, was the
sixth-century Welshman, Maucan (the name means
"master"), who was head of a religious collegiate
establishment in Pembrokeshire, and there instructed
many of the missionaries to Ireland
and Cornwall, who afterwards became sainted,
in the copious hagiology of the West.</p>

<p>Ecclesiastically, this village of Mawgan is
"in Kerrier," but it is generally styled "in
Meneage": the second syllable pronounced as
in the word "vague."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>But "village" is only a conventional term,
as applied here. There are but half a dozen scattered
cottages to keep company with the large
and beautiful church.</p>

<div id="Fig_i_156" class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_156.jpg" width="400" height="601" alt="" />
<div class="caption">HAGIOSCOPE, MAWGAN-IN-MENEAGE.</div>
</div>

<p>I sketched this view of Mawgan church in
"soft weather," with rain oozing down&mdash;not
falling&mdash;a way it has in Cornwall. And a rustic
came to the stable opposite and opened the
door, and said, "Come forth, my son." I expected
a boy to come out in reply to that somewhat
Biblical and patriarchal invitation, but it
was a horse! So, just as in Brittany, where you
only get the "vraie Breton bretonnante" far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
away from the towns, you find your characteristic
expressions in the remote nooks and corners of
Cornwall.</p>

<p>The greater part of Mawgan church is of
the late Perpendicular period. A curiously constructed
hagioscope, at the angle of the south
transept, is equally remarkable for the large
blocks of granite used in it, and for a low side
window, now blocked up by the addition of a
vestry. There is a somewhat similar, but not so
good, hagioscope at Cury.</p>

<p>A long way down Helford River from Mawgan
comes Helford, a hamlet in the parish of Manaccan.
Helford is at the opposite side of the ferry to
Durgan, and lies down in a deep hollow of the
hills. Many charmingly rustic cottages and a
delightful old farmhouse face an inner creek.
It is hot and steamy at Helford, and great pink
ivy-geraniums ramble over the house-fronts,
sprawl over the thatch, and peep inquiringly
into bedroom windows.</p>

<p>Manaccan sits upon the hill-top. The great
uncertainty often existing as to the origin and
meaning of place-names is well illustrated here.
Manaccan is well within the district of Meneage,
which, by fairly general consent, is taken to mean
the "stony district," but there are those who
declare it to be in its origin "mynachau," that
is to say, "monkland." "Manaccan" has also
generally been considered to mean "the monks,"
but as the church is dedicated to Saints Menaacus
and Dunstan, it seems more likely that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
place takes its name from the first of these.
Menaacus, Mancus, or Marnach, an early bishop,
is buried, according to William of Worcester, in
the church of Lanreath, near Fowey, and Lanlivery
church is also dedicated to him.</p>

<p>The church is partly Early English, and
has a very good Norman south door. A curious
feature is the very flourishing fig-tree that grows
out of the wall at the junction of the tower and
nave, on the south side.</p>

<p>Manaccan stands on a lofty hill, softly clothed
in rich fields and luxuriant trees, not in the
least characteristic of the stony Meneage district
in which it is situated.</p>

<p>From the heights of Manaccan a steep road,
heavily shaded by tall elms, leads to a parting
of the ways, whence you may go direct to St.
Keverne, or turn aside to the left for the Durra
Creek of Helford River, which is some two miles
in length, ending in what map-makers style
"Dennis Point," a corruption of "Dinas," an
ancient British word signifying a fortress of
the earthwork and wooden palisade type, constructed
at the extremity of a headland, with the
approach across the neck of it cut off by a ditch.
There is one of these strongholds on either side
of the entrance to the creek from the sea. Rabbits
hold the fort to-day, but should there come a
time when invasions threaten these parts, there
can be little doubt of the eternal and unchanging
requirements of strategy bringing these salient
points again into use, just as, when the last
conflicts in the great civil war were disturbing
the nation, the Royalists established themselves
here, only to be turned out by Fairfax.</p>

<div class="caption">ST. ANTHONY IN MENEAGE.</div>
</div>

<p>The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span> Durra Creek is generally passed by. Tourists
hasten on to St. Keverne, and know nothing
of the lovely rugged woodland road that runs
beside the water to the church&mdash;one can scarce
say the village for there are but two or three
houses, including the vicarage&mdash;of St. Anthony-in-Meneage.
St. Anthony stands at the very
verge of high water, where a little beach ends,
on the landward side, in grassy banks and blackberry
tangles, from which spring great elms.
Trees close in everywhere, with the grey granite
tower of the church in their midst and a lovely
old vicarage adjoining, wrapped, as it were, in
flowers. There is not, nor ever could have been,
any need for a church at this spot, and thus
the legend accounting for its origin may very
well be true. According to this story, some
notables voyaging from Normandy in mediæval
times were in great peril of shipwreck, and vowed
St. Anthony a church if he would only bring
them in safety to shore. They made land here,
in the Durra Creek, and accordingly the church
was built at the place where they set foot. There
are numerous legends of this kind in Cornwall,
and all around our coasts; and there is, in general,
no occasion to doubt their truth, the absolute
uselessness, as a rule, of these votive churches
being presumptive evidence of the genuine character
of their story. At the same time, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
impossible to believe that St. Anthony, or the
saints to whom those other churches are dedicated,
personally intervened because they were promised
churches in places where they could not possibly
advance the cause of religion. Surely we ought
to have a better opinion of the saints than to
believe them animated by such appeals to personal
vanity.</p>

<p>The church of St. Anthony-in-Meneage fell
gradually into decay. It was "awl davered,"
as they say in these parts, <em>i.e.</em> mildewed, and
was not restored until recent years, when its
mouldy interior was cleaned and the rotting
woodwork removed. The usual cheap and nasty
fittings of pitch-pine have been installed in their
place. It was impossible to spare the decayed
woodwork, of which two fragments remain in
the tower. The vicar, at the time when the
present writer was here, brought them forth
to show a boating-party who had landed on
the beach, and the party gushed plentifully over
them. "How beautiful! how interesting!" they
exclaimed; insincerely, because any beauty or
interest they may once have had has utterly
vanished, and left merely two almost formless
logs, not good enough for firewood. The really
interesting object no one understood or appreciated.
This was the beautiful granite font of
the thirteenth century, an exceptionally interesting
example, one of the somewhat rare inscribed
fonts. It is adorned with shield-bearing angels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and has the inscription, "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ecce Karissimi de Deo
vero baptizabuntur spiritu sancto</i>," with the initials,
Q.P., B.M., B.V., P.R., repeated. No one appears
ever to have explained the significance of those
initials, but it may perhaps be considered that
they are not only those of the donors, which
seems obvious enough, but that they are also
those of the storm-tossed voyagers who gave
the church.</p>

<p>Inside the protecting shoulder of Nare Point
lies Porthallow, a fishing cove, and beyond it,
in the next bight, is Porthoustock, whose fishing
is now mixed with the exportation of granite.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Up out of Porthoustock, over the hill and on
to the next point, and you have come to the
most recently tragical outlook upon the Cornish
seas, for there, offshore, lie the Manacles rocks.
No one but a seaman would take particular note
of them, for they do but rise unobtrusively from
the water.</p>

<p>Their odd name, forbidding and ominous
though it be, and apparently allusive to the
fast hold they often keep upon vessels unlucky
enough to go out of their course among them,
is only accidental; their original title having
been, in the Cornish language, "maen eglos,"
the "church stone." Why they were so called
does not appear. A bell-buoy, floating out there,
giving out a harsh knell, might seem to justify
the name, but the rocks were so called long
centuries before the Trinity House placed their
buoy here. There is no sadder sound than
that of a bell-buoy, tolling on the brightest
day with the note of a funeral knell; a likeness
well justified here, for many have been cast
away on the Manacles, notably in the wreck of
the <em>Dispatch</em> transport, January 25th, 1809,
when sixty-four were lost; and in that of the
<em>John</em> emigrant ship, May 1855, with the loss of
nearly two hundred.</p>

<p>The terrible wreck of the American steamship
<em>Mohegan</em>, on Friday, October 14th, 1898, is the
latest tragedy associated with the fatal Manacles.
The vessel was on its way to New York, and
had left London the day before, carrying fifty-three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
saloon passengers, a crew of one hundred
and seven, and a stowaway. Between half-past
six and seven o'clock, when the saloon passengers
were at dinner, every one on board was suddenly
terrified by a violent crashing and grinding and
a succession of shocks, indicating only too surely
that the vessel had run upon a reef. All the
ship's lights went out, and the horror of darkness
was added to the peril of the occasion.</p>

<p>The sun sets at nine minutes past five in
the evening on October 14th, and it is normally
quite light for an hour later. It is therefore
incapable of explanation how, in something like
another half-hour, the <em>Mohegan</em> should have
been as much as ten miles out of her course,
especially as the south-westerly trend of the
land towards the Lizard must have been very
noticeable. Nor are these coasts ill-lighted. The
Eddystone and Falmouth harbour lights, which
the <em>Mohegan</em> had already passed, and the Lizard
light ahead, form a remarkable triangular display
for the guidance of the mariner. But it should
be noted, perhaps, that the last half-hour of
daylight may be especially dangerous. The lighthouses
have already lit their warning beams, but
they are only faintly to be seen in the still radiant
western sky, and only gather strength when the
afterglow has died away and darkness falls upon
the restless sea and the sombre coast. Another
explanation of the captain being so far out of
his reckoning was sought in the <em>Mohegan</em> being
a new ship, and her compasses possibly not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
true; but nothing can actually be known, for
all the officers of the ship were drowned. A
strong south-easterly wind was blowing at the
time, and the bell-buoy on the southern ledge
of the Manacles at such times rings loudly; but
no one on board appears to have heard its warning.
Only two boats could be launched, so swiftly did
the <em>Mohegan</em> sink, and one of them was capsized.
The Porthoustock lifeboat saved many, but
one hundred and six were drowned.</p>

<div class="caption"><em>Gibson &amp; Sons, Penzance.</em>] WRECK OF THE <em>GLENBERVIE</em>, ON LOWLANDS POINT.</div>
</div>

<p>A landsman, looking out on some calm day
from the low headland that stretches insignificantly
out to sea south of St. Keverne cannot easily
comprehend the dangers of the scatter of rocks
extending seaward for nearly a mile and a half.
The spot is by no means dramatic. It is even
commonplace, and has no hint of the scenes of
terror and despair that have been enacted out
yonder. And the photographs of the wreck that
were afterwards plentifully taken are probably
the tamest among such things, showing merely
the funnel and the four masts standing upright
from the waves and disclosing that the <em>Mohegan</em>
sank on an even keel in comparatively shallow
water. Those views, taken from the water, on
a calm sea, only, in the present writer's imagination,
add to the pity of the occasion, for in shallow
water and so near land, it seems exceptionally
hard that so many should have lost their lives.
The remarkable attraction of the Manacles rocks
for vessels was illustrated the following year,
when the <em>Paris</em> strayed among them, happily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
with no disastrous results. The Glasgow barque
<em>Glenbervie</em> struck in moderate weather one night,
in January 1902, on the Ray, a rock two miles
distant, off Lowlands Point, and although the
crew were saved, the vessel became a total loss.</p>

<p>The narrow and miraculous escapes from
among this tangle of reefs have been many.
The <cite>Cornish Magazine</cite>, now extinct, once published
an article, in which the writer spoke of a
Porthoustock fisherman telling him, from memory,
the names of thirty vessels of all kinds, from
steamships down to ketches, that had been
totally lost here. He told a thrilling tale of a
ship drifting inshore in a fog, and of the captain
anchoring until the fog cleared away, when he
sailed off in safety, to the astonishment of the
many who had collected on the cliffs. There
was also the story of the steamship which came
so close to the cliffs that the noise of her engines
could be distinctly heard on shore, but she, too,
got away. Many have been the ships among
the Manacles, and no word ever said about it;
their captains even going the length of covering
over the name of their vessels with a sail, lest
their mistake in navigation should be published
to the world.</p>

<p>The village of St. Keverne lies rather over
a mile inland.</p>

<p>"St. Keverne" is another form of "St.
Piran." It has also been spelled "Keveran"
and "Kieran." Its church is very large and
roomy, and is one of those few in Cornwall that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
have a spire. The fine inscribed font has demi-angels
at the angles, holding crossed swords.</p>

<img src="images/i_170.jpg" width="600" height="419" alt="" />
<div class="caption">ST. KEVERNE.</div>
</div>

<p>In the churchyard, among other memorials
of shipwreck, is the granite cross, bearing the
simple inscription, "<span class="smcap">MOHEGAN, R.I.P.</span>" marking
where lie many of the dead who were lost in that
wreck. Near by is the touching epitaph upon
"Charles Cyril Brownjohn, London, aged 23.
<span class="smcap">S.S.</span> <em>Mohegan</em>, Oct. 14, 1898. The devoted and
only son of a widowed mother. He never said
an unkind word to her in his life."</p>

<p>I do not think there were ever any distinguished
persons born at St. Keverne. One notoriety,
Sir James Tillie, was born here, and one
other was vicar, as would appear from the records<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
of 1467, in which, among a number of piratical
Cornishmen, who had helped themselves to a
quantity of merchandise from a Breton ship, we
find the vicar, whose share of the booty was three
tuns of wine. An order was given to arrest these
enterprising persons, but they could not be found;
and so St. Keverne apparently had a new, and let
us hope, a better, vicar.</p>

<p>Striking inland from St. Keverne for Coverack
Cove, something of the stony character of the
Meneage and Lizard districts is seen, together
with a good deal of the widespread lack of signposts
common to all Cornwall, but particularly
distressing here. Wherever it is possible for a
stranger to lose his way&mdash;and that is very often
here&mdash;be very sure that the County Council has
forgotten to place a sign-post; and furthermore,
be equally certain that, at those points where no
one is likely to go wrong, there will be very informative
ones: exercises in the obvious. But
there is a deeper depth than this. A fork of roads
may be duly sign-posted, but it often leads to
another, and a much more puzzling and quite
lonely fork, a long way ahead, where not the least
indication is vouchsafed. You are lucky if you
do not at last find yourself in the yard of some
"farm-place," and have to return a mile or more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Sorrow's crown of sorrow is, however, attained
when a signpost is seen in the distance. You
hurry up; it points the way to, let us say, the
"Hotel Parvenu," one of the several up-to-date
barrack hotels that have of late risen upon desirable
view-points. I want to know why these
things should be; not the hotels&mdash;we know the
reason of them&mdash;but why they should be allowed
to play these dirty tricks on travellers. We cannot
all be guests; nor, perhaps, would very many
who could. Why, then, should the County Council
permit the existence of these purely commercial
notices?</p>

<p>Coverack village, down upon the Cove, was
the scene of the <em>Dispatch</em> transport wreck in
January 1809. A monument in St. Keverne
church narrates how over sixty were lost on
that occasion, including Major-General Cavendish.
They were fresh from the blood-soaked fields of
Spain and the retreat upon Coruña.</p>

<p>Those who originally named Black Head, beyond
Coverack, could scarce have had any choice
in the matter, for it is a lowering, sullen-looking
point. But the rock is rather a dark green in its
original tone, when closely examined. It is, in
fact, the famed "serpentine" rock that extends
all the way from this place, past the Lizard, to
Mullion.</p>

<p>The way round by the cliffs to the next headland,
Pedn Boar, and beyond it to Caraclowse
Point, where there is a "cliff castle," is wearying
in its ups and downs with a stream to cross in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
rugged valley, without being exceptionally fine;
but the paths or ragged grasslands on the way
to Kennack Sands give easier going. Kennack
Sands form the only available sandy foreshore for
many miles along this rugged coast, where the
savage cliffs descend as a rule sheer to the water,
and the jealous sea generally leaves but a narrow
sandy selvedge at the ebb. Small wonder, then,
that bungalows for summer bathers have appeared
here.</p>

<p>But the trivial urbanities of Kennack soon
fail him who fares by the cliffs on to Caerleon Cove
and Poltesco. Brambles clutch at his clothes
and bid him stay; stones, loose and knobbly, and
tripsome, lie along the path the coastguards seem
to patrol all too seldom, and presently the small
cove of Caerleon appears, with a stream running
down to it and the derelict works of an abandoned
serpentine factory on the shore. Up inland, past
a cottage, with a notice declaring that trespassers
will be prosecuted (which of course the wise
pedestrian treats with contempt), and then past
a tree-surrounded farmhouse, displaying the more
hospitable intimation of new milk being sold,
the watery valley of Poltesco is reached, where a
great mill-wheel, amid a paradise of ferns, is worked
by the spattering stream. I should think Poltesco
might be a very tedious place on a wet November
day, and not good for rheumatism; but, as an
American girl tourist remarked, in summer it is
"just heavenly."</p>

<p>Abandoning the coast at this point, and content<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
with seeing Ynys Head in the distance, I walked
the half-mile uphill to Ruan Minor, a pretty little
village with a very small but very perfect little
Perpendicular church, whose pinnacled tower,
although well-proportioned, is not higher than
the roofs of the village houses.</p>

<div id="Fig_i_175" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_175.jpg" width="600" height="406" alt="" />
<div class="caption">CADGWITH COVE.</div>
</div>

<p>The half-mile hence to Cadgwith Cove is a
zigzagging and steep descent. Deep down lies
the village, with a street clinging to the sides of
the descent and thatched cottages at the bottom,
facing the sea; one or two in front of their fellows
standing on a rocky projection called "The
Rodden." The sea comes hissing in upon a
pebbly beach, alongside tall, sheer cliffs.</p>

<p>It is even steeper up out of Cadgwith on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
coastguard path to the Lizard than on the other
side; an obscure path leading up to scrubby fields
and a modern villa called "White Heather,"
facing the sea in what seems a not altogether
permanently safe position, considering that the
"Devil's Frying Pan" is in front of it. This is
a chasm formed in the cliffs by the falling in of the
roof of a cave, leaving a huge pit-like opening
in the cliff-top, with a neck of land forming a
natural arch on the edge of the cliffs. Down
below, the sea comes foaming and hissing at high
tide among the scattered boulders in a way that
suggested to some imaginative person the idea of
a frying-pan. A not very safe path leads round
the landward edge of this place; but the best and
most impressive view is from the sea. It is a very
short boating trip from Cadgwith to the Devil's
Frying Pan.</p>

<p>A boating trip is certainly the best method of
seeing the coast between Cadgwith and the Lizard.
You see more, and to better advantage, than by
tramping round the interminable headlands and
down one not very interesting valley, up to the
next hill, conscious all the while that the real
beauty of the coast lies under your feet, in the
sea-fretted caverns that the waves never leave.
The finest of these is Dolor Hugo: <i lang="kw" xml:lang="kw">ogof</i>, the old
Cornish word for "cave." This is a magnificent
cavern in the dark but richly variegated serpentine
rock. The archway rises high overhead,
admitting boats easily in calm weather, but the
roof soon descends and exploration cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
pushed far. The Lizard boatmen, too, are very
alive to the dangers of the place. The solemn
beauty of it and the heavy ground-swell impress
the stranger with a full sense of the risks incurred
in visiting Dolor Hugo, except in the calmest
weather.</p>

<div id="Fig_i_177" class="figcenter" style="width: 585px;">
<img src="images/i_177.jpg" width="585" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">THE "DEVIL'S FRYING PAN."</div>
</div>

<p>At Cambarrow, the next headland, is the cavern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
of Ravens' Hugo, a narrower fissure, the entrance
hung with wild growths. Then comes the sheer
cliff called "The Balk," where serpentine quarries
may be observed, and round its precipitous adamantine
wall the deeply cleft little Church Cove,
known also as Perranvose, Parnvoose, or Lizard
Cove.</p>

<p>Church Cove itself is an almost solitary place,
a narrow strip of beach between sheer rocks; but
the cottages along the tree-shaded lane that runs
up to Landewednack are as homely and sheltered,
and as richly embowered in roses, fuchsias, honeysuckle,
and hydrangeas, as any place in the West.
All around is the level, treeless, windswept heath
of the Lizard district, but down in this sheltered
hollow one is in the atmosphere of a conservatory.
Perhaps one person among every hundred of those
who come to Lizard Town discovers Church Cove
and the village of Landewednack, which is the
mother-village whence Lizard Town, half a mile
away, has sprung; and the ninety and nine
return home, having just caught a glimpse of the
lighthouse, and think, vainly, they have seen all
there is to be seen.</p>

<p>I have quite a budget of curious facts concerning
Landewednack and its church. To begin
with, it is the parish church of that odd collection
of houses&mdash;the very negation of architecture&mdash;"Lizard
Town," which occupies the plateau just
beyond this dell. That a place should elect to
style itself "Lizard Town," when it might be,
and properly is, Landewednack, is an odd study in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
perversity. Landewednack church is also the
most southerly church in England, and in it was
preached in 1674 the last sermon in the Cornish
language. A few years later, 1683, died the
Rev. Thomas Cole, stated in the register to have
been 120 years of age. In the churchyard lie
a number of persons who died of the plague in
1645, but the spot where they were laid is unmarked.</p>

<div id="Fig_i_179" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_179.jpg" width="600" height="374" alt="" />
<div class="caption">LANDEWEDNACK.</div>
</div>

<p>Furthermore, the stranger will not fail to observe
that the huge stones of which the tower is
built are partly grey granite and partly of local
serpentine, giving a curiously irregular chessboard
kind of appearance. The dedication of the
church is said to be to St. Winwaloe. The place-name
has its fellow in Brittany&mdash;that other
Cornwall&mdash;in Landevenec.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>The church of Landewednack consists of
nave, north aisle, and a south transept, which has
a low side-window at the angle formed by its
eastern wall and the wall of the nave. The font,
dating from about 1404, is mounted on four
modern pillars of polished serpentine. The bowl
bears an inscription including the name of the
rector at that period, "<span class="smallfont">I.H.C. D.</span> Ric. Bolham me
fecit."</p>

<p>And now we come to Lizard Town. No one
ever planned Lizard Town, any more than its
houses were designed. They were merely built,
and the "town," which is a simple collection of
cottages and a hotel or two of sorts, is much
smaller than many villages. Its population, including
Landewednack, is only 683. Lizard Town
simply grew at haphazard, on the extremity of
the level, heather-clad waste of the Lizard promontory,
and with so little directing hand or
purposeful mind that its component houses form
hardly any recognisable lines of streets, running
in any definite directions. They may be fitly
likened to a flock of sheep huddled together,
facing all ways, to escape a tempest raging from
all quarters at once. The population appears
to a casual observer to consist wholly of families
of Jose and Roberts, all inter-related, like the
Cadgwith people, who are all either Janes or
Stevenses. And they are nearly all workers in
serpentine, whose little workrooms and shops
are all of one peculiar pattern, with a small
show-window closed at night by a hinged shutter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
In every one of these shanties a lathe is at work
shaping the rough serpentine rock down, and
then turning it into one or other of the many
ornamental articles exposed for sale in the windows:
paper-weights, candlesticks, pen-trays,
models of the Eddystone lighthouse and of
Cornish crosses, and so forth; beautifully polished.
"Serpentine" gets its name from the coloured
streaks and patches it displays.</p>

<p>The "Lizard district" is the name given to
all that boldly projecting peninsula south of the
Helford River: the district that is properly
"Meneage," the "stony district," but "Lizard"
is only rightly applied to the actual headland.
It has nothing to do with the reptile lizards,
but is equal to the Welsh "Llidiart," indicating
a rocky height. There is a Weston-under-Lizard
in Staffordshire. The peninsula forms the most
southerly projection of England, and the Lizard
Point by day or the Lizard Light by night is
the first glimpse homeward-bound voyagers obtain
of old England from the decks of the great steamships
passing up Channel. It is a wild, but
scarcely picturesque land, consisting of a high,
but level, plateau of heaths and moors. Goonhilly
Downs, in its centre, in spite of their name,
are not hilly, nor are they what we generally
understand to be downs, but just gently undulating,
or even flat, stretches of uncultivated
and uncultivable land that by some are styled
"dreary." But the justness or otherwise of
that expression entirely depends upon the circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
of the moment. Given bad weather,
Goonhilly Downs and the whole Lizard peninsula
are, indeed, dreary to the traveller, for shelter along
the exposed roads, for the most part treeless,
lonely, and quite innocent of hedges, is unobtainable
for many miles; but in fine weather the
purple heather, the occasional wooded hollows
and the innumerable grey boulders scattered in
these wilds, make a pleasant holiday jaunt.
From a cycling point of view, the roads are
perfection, and although dreariness is again the
word when a cyclist strives along them in the
teeth of a gale, to be blown mile after mile on
a cycle with the wind is exhilarating. There
are few villages here. Inland from Lizard Town
you see the church-tower of Grade peering across
the flats, but it is a village only of "farm-places."
Grade church takes its name from St. Grada,
Crida, or Credanus, a more or less mythical
companion of St. Petroc, but it has been re-dedicated
to Holy Cross.</p>

<p>Even less of a village is Ruan Major, whose
church is seen amid a cluster of trees on the
right of the road to Helston. Ruan Major is a
paradoxical place, much smaller than Ruan
Minor, consisting as it does of a church and a
farmhouse. St. Ruan, or Rumon, its godfather,
was a sixth-century Irish hermit who resided
here&mdash;if that mode of living may be called residence&mdash;both
before and after he went to Brittany,
where he was not altogether favourably received.
That he was much better thought of in Cornwall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
and Devonshire seems evident in the places
named after him, and in the great honour paid
to his relics at Tavistock Abbey. The farm at
Ruan Major and the little woodland distinguishing
the place from the surrounding open heaths
perhaps represent the "nymet," or sacred enclosure
made by St. Ruan around his hermitage.</p>

<p>Such then, with an occasional old manor-house
and park like Trelowarren, Bochyn, and
Bonython, the last near Cury, formerly seat of
the old family of Bonython, is the wide district
at the back of Lizard Town. Strangers simply
hurry over it, by motor-car or Great Western
motor-omnibus, all anxious to reach the Lizard
itself, and to explore Kynance Cove and be off
again.</p>

<p>The Lizard lighthouse is three-quarters of a
mile distant from Lizard Town. It occupies the
extremity of the point, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ocrinum</i> of Ptolemy,
and is the successor of a lighthouse first erected
in 1619 by Sir John Killigrew. That early light
was only established in the teeth of the strongest
discouragement by the Trinity House, which in
those times adopted what seems to us an extraordinary
policy, directed against the increase of
lighthouses. Sir John Killigrew proposed to set
up a light here at his own expense and to gather
voluntary contributions from ship-owners towards
the cost of it, but he found it necessary
to first obtain a licence to do so, and therefore
petitioned James the First to that effect. He
would pay twenty nobles a year for leave to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
collect voluntary sums for a term of thirty years.
This proposition, submitted to the Trinity House,
produced the criticism that a light was not
required upon the Lizard, and that in fact any
such light would be dangerous, for it would
serve as a beacon for pirates and foreign enemies.
But the King, really in this instance the Solomon
his flatterers pretended him to be, disregarded
the unfavourable report, and granted the petition,
with the only proviso that the light should be
extinguished in time of war, when the approach
of an enemy was suspected. Killigrew thereupon
began and soon completed his lighthouse, much
to the anger of the coastwise people. "The
inabytants neer by," wrote Killigrew, "think
they suffer by this erection. They affirme I
take away God's grace from them. Their English
meaning is that now they shall receve no more
benefitt by shipwreck, for this will prevent yt.
They have been so long used to repe profitt by
the calamyties of the ruin of shipping that they
clayme it heredytarye, and heavely complayne
on me."</p>

<p>A year's working, including the cost of building,
cost Sir John Killigrew £500. The light
displayed was a brazier of coal, and this alone
cost ten shillings a night. As for the "voluntary
contributions" expected, they were simply nonexistent,
and in consequence Killigrew petitioned
for, and obtained, the right to levy dues of one
halfpenny a ton on all passing vessels. Even
then, he took nothing but a loss out of his enterprise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
for shipowners, backed by the Trinity
House, refused to pay, and in the end the lighthouse
was pulled down.</p>

<p>The existing lighthouse dates from 1748,
when a Captain Farrish proposed a building that
should display four lights. This was a wholly
commercial speculation. Farrish proposed to pay
a yearly sum of £80 to the Trinity House for
leave to build, and obtained a lease of sixty-one
years; but the lease was taken over and the
lighthouse actually built by Thomas Fonnereau.
The lights were first displayed on August 22nd,
1752, in the presence of a great assemblage of
people, who had come long distances to honour
the event. Two lights appear to have been
substituted for the four in 1792, but not until
1813 did the coal braziers give place to oil, and
oil was replaced by the electric light in 1878.
About 1902 the lights were reduced to one powerful
revolving electric beam, the strongest in the
world, visible for twenty-three miles, and
showing once in every three seconds. It is
aided in foggy weather by the most dismal of
foghorns.</p>

<p>Hard by the lighthouse stands a notice-board
of the National Lifeboat Institution, giving a
plain record of the doings of the successive lifeboats
that have been established down below,
in Polpear Cove.</p>

<p>The Lizard lifeboats have rendered noble
service, as shown by the board telling the doings
of them:</p>

<p>The bald, unvarnished statement in this list
under date of March 17th to 18th, 1907, giving
the list of saved from the <em>Suevic</em>, hides the very
narrow escape of the passengers and crew of that
White Star liner. She was homeward-bound
from Australia, and had on board between three
and four hundred passengers, and a cargo of
frozen meat. In the middle of the night she
struck upon the Brandies Rocks, immediately
under the Lizard lighthouse; thus affording
another extraordinary instance of the fatal attraction
this, the most salient southerly point of
land in England, has for vessels, in spite of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
lighthouse exhibiting the most powerful light
in the world. The Lizard, Cadgwith and Mullion
lifeboats put out, on hearing the news, and landed
many of the passengers, and one hundred and
forty were taken off by the tug <em>Triton</em> of Falmouth.
Fortunately the weather was moderate.
The hull was severed by dynamite about a week
later, and towed round to Falmouth.</p>

<p>Scattered reefs stretch out beyond Lizard
Point, and form the special dangers of the place.
They are known in general as "The Stags." A
vessel, wrecked on the Stags about 1845, was driven
on to the island rock of Crenval, where the crew
refuged all night, while the good ship was being
reduced to matchwood by the waves. The next
morning they were brought ashore, and were
greeted by their own cat, which had either swum
to land, or had been carried on the wreckage.
Its tail had somehow been nipped off in the
process. The cat was sold to an innkeeper in
Lizard Town, and was long looked upon as very
much of a hero.</p>

<p>Immediately to the eastward of the lighthouse
is the funnel formed in the cliffs by the
falling in of the roof of a cave known as
Daws' Hugo. This subsidence happened on
February 19th, 1847, and the hollow thus produced
was immediately given the name of
"Lion's Den." Beyond it is Housel Bay, with
a hotel on the cliffs. The rugged Penolver Head
comes next, and then the amphitheatrical Belidden
Cove, with Beast, or Bass Point, enclosing it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Lloyd's signalling station, displaying the word
LLOYD'S in gigantic letters on its sea-front,
stands on Beast Point. Hence inward and outward-bound
ships are telegraphed to London as
having "passed the Lizard." Beyond Hot Point,
the next headland, the coast comes to Kilcobbin
Cove and again to Church Cove.</p>

POST-OFFICE&mdash;SIGNPOSTS&mdash;GUE GRAZE&mdash;MULLION
COVE&mdash;WRECK OF THE "JONKHEER"&mdash;MARY
MUNDY AND THE "OLD INN"</span></h2>

<p>From Polpear Cove to Kynance Cove is a tramp
to be undertaken only by the leisured. The
distance is but four miles along the cliffs, but
the hurried persons who oftenest come to the
Lizard have not the time or the inclination for
it, and go direct across from Lizard Town.</p>

<p>The way to Kynance Cove from Lizard Town
is strictly a pedestrian's journey and lies largely
upon the tops of hedges. Those who have never
yet made the acquaintance of a Cornish hedge
cannot fail to be surprised at this, but a hedge
in the Home Counties and a hedge in the West
Country are apt to be very different things, and
a Cornish hedge is generally a substantial bank
of stones and earth, not infrequently with a
broad, well-defined footpath on top. Such hedges
are those that partly conduct to Kynance Cove.</p>

<p>But I shall proceed by the cliffs, first noting
the cave that is to be seen at low water down
at Polpear, and the Man-o'-War Rocks out at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
sea. The name was originally "Maen-an-Vawr,"
the "great stones," but the tradition of the
wreck of a transport there has definitely changed
it. The cliff-walk passes "Pistol Meadow," in
which numerous mounds still show the places
where the seven hundred dead on that occasion
were buried. Only two persons are said to have
been saved. It is strange that neither the date
of the wreck nor the name of the ship has been
preserved.</p>

<p>Old Lizard Head, the "false Lizard" as it is
sometimes called, gives way to Crane Cove and
the larger cove of Caerthillian, where a stream
comes down a ravine to the shore. This in
turn is succeeded by Pentraeth Beach and by
the tall cliffs of Yellow Carn, with the rock of
Ynys Vean, <em>i.e.</em> "Little Island," about as big as
Westminster Abbey, below.</p>

<p>And down there in front is Kynance Cove, a
not very remarkable place at high tide, but of
a justly famous beauty at low water. You look
down upon it from the cliff called the "Tar Box,"
which has not the slightest suggestion of tar in
its composition: it is properly "Tor Balk." A
stream comes swirling down the rock-strewn
valley that descends to the Cove. It is from
this the Ky-nans, <em>i.e.</em> "Dog's Brook" it is
said, that Kynance Cove takes its name.</p>

<div id="Fig_i_191" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_191.jpg" width="600" height="339" alt="" />
<div class="caption">KYNANCE COVE.</div>
</div>

<p>There are but two or three cottages here.
Not yet has a hotel been built, but who knows
how long before such a thing shall come to
pass, and it be possible to sit at a window of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
dining-room, overlooking this most typical Cornish
scenery, while a German waiter, introducing the
soup, asks: "Thig or glear?" May it be long
years yet!</p>

<p>Every one knows that the beauties of Kynance
are only unveiled at the ebb. Then the sands,
the delightful, soft, light-yellow sands appear,
where were only heaving waters, and the great
islanded rocks are seen embedded in them.
There is plenty of colour, and plenty of drawing
too, at Kynance: the streaked black, green,
purple, red, and pink serpentine rocks, the yellow
sands, and the translucent green sea glow brilliantly
under a sunny sky; and under any conditions,
except fog, the Cove at ebb is full of
striking forms. On the west side, between the
mainland and the crag called Asparagus Island,
rises the Steeple Rock, sometimes called the
Soap Rock, from the veins of steatite it contains.
It is no fanciful name, for quarries of steatite
were worked long ago in the cliffs beyond Rill
Head, and the product dispatched to wholesale
soap-boilers, and also to Staffordshire, for use in
pottery-making. No asparagus now grows on
Asparagus Island, which is a rather fearsome,
craggy place to climb, especially as not merely a
fall on jagged rocks is possible, but a descent
afterwards into the horrible green depths of the
sea, where the congers live. For this chamoising
over the rocks rubber-soled shoes are the best
and safest. In them you may dare things not
easily to be contemplated in less pliant footgear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and thus may scale the pinnacled rock, and look
down from its further side on to Gull Rock and
the deep-water channel below.</p>

<p>But the most engaging thing about Asparagus
Island is the Devil's Post-Office, which (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">facilis
descensus Averni</i>, you know!) is quite easily
reached. It is in working order just below half-tide.
At the flood it is entirely submerged.
Sometimes it is known as the Devil's Bellows,
or again as the Devil's Throat; but whether
it be Throat, Bellows, or Post Office, the personality
of the owner is unchanged. This natural
curiosity is a fissure traversing the entire mass
of Asparagus Island, through which the sea-water
is forced in conjunction with air, emerging
violently and with a reverberating rumbling
report, through a narrow slit, not unlike a letterbox.
To "post a letter" at this aperture immediately
after one of these spoutings is rather
a startling experience, unless you have been
told of it beforehand. You unsuspectingly lean
over and hold a piece of paper at the orifice, and
it is rudely and violently snatched away, to the
tune of a harsh indrawn snarl, a sound just as
though a giant had sharply drawn his breath
in between his teeth. And very often it will
happen that, in a sudden outrush again of air
and water, your letter will be returned to you
full in the face on the instant, with a most discourteous
drenching. There are gorgeous caverns,
dry at low-water, round past the Steeple Rock,
known as the Drawing-Room, the Kitchen, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the Parlour; but the finest view-point at Kynance
is eastward, back towards the Lizard, with the
Lion Rock in the foreground.</p>

<p>The Lion Rock is doubtless so called because
it has a certain majesty of outline, and because
it does suggest a crouching attitude, as of an
animal in readiness for an attack. But it does
not look like a lion, and indeed lacks a head,
and without a head the noblest lion is a
poor thing. But it is true that the longer
you look at the Lion Rock, the more you are
impressed.</p>

<p>Let those who seek to return direct inland
to Lizard Town have a care how they follow
the direction indicated by a signpost, which
obligingly indicates "The nearest way to Lizard
Town." I am inclined to think that the old
piskies, devils, and malicious sprites that used to
inhabit Cornwall and lure travellers out of their
way, now occupy the bodies of all those people
who have anything to do with signposts. They
generally manage in some way to mislead, and
very often indeed they are repainted at the
height of the tourist season, when strangers are
mostly about; and who else beside a stranger
has any need of a signpost?</p>

<p>That is to say, the first part of the repainting&mdash;the
obliterating of the inscription&mdash;is done
then: the re-lettering may, and does, wait.
This is a joke so entirely after the heart of one
of those inimical old sprites that I am convinced,
though they be gone, their wicked souls go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
marching on in the persons of road-surveyors
and people of that breed.</p>

<p>But the wickedness of the Kynance Cove signpost
lies in the fact that, although it tells of
Lizard Town, its arm points slightly away from
it, along a rough cart-track. Now, as in an otherwise
roadless and pathless moor such as this
the inclination is always to follow any sort of a
track, how much more likely then it is that the
stranger should take this cart-track, especially
when the signpost points to it! And, you know,
it leads right away inland; and at last, after a
long while, you see Lizard Town, miles away on
the right, across the flatness of the heath. In
tracking then across to it, in that hummocky
wilderness of gorse and heather, you soon grow
quite familiar with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Erica vagans</i>, the Cornish
heather, which botanists say is peculiar to the
soil of this district, and get an intimate acquaintance
with the prickly qualities of gorse.</p>

<p>Resuming the way along the cliffs from
Kynance, Rill Head projects boldly, with a pile
of rocks on its summit known as the Apron-String.
Here, according to the legend, the Devil dropped
an apron full of stones he was carrying, to build
a bridge across Channel for smugglers to come
over. In despair, he then abandoned the task.
I do not think this can be a genuinely old legend,
for the Cornish, in company with all seashore
peoples, were too prone toward smuggling, and
thought it too natural a thing, for the suggestion
of a devilish coadjutor to come from them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
"The Horse" is the name of the next headland,
with a dangerous saddle-backed ridge, infinitely
tempting to adventurous climbers who do not
mind bestriding it, with the knowledge that a
false step will probably send them to Kingdom
Come on the moment. In the dour, black little
Cove, "the Horsepond," overlooked by beetling
cliffs, is Pigeon Hugo, only to be seen from a
boat.</p>

<p>The scenery has here again attained to a
black and savage grandeur, and the sea is not
to be reached at all except at the deep hollow
in the cliffs known as Gue Graze. Here were
situated the soapstone quarries, and streaks of
steatite, the "soapstone" in question, are easily
found. They are of a dirty white hue and the
substance feels greasy or soapy to the touch.
Chemically, it is "magnesia," and commercially
is generally known as "French chalk," used in
softening boots and shoes, and by tailors.</p>

<p>The bold promontory of Vellan Head now
leads round to Pol Cornick, and then to the
bastioned heights of Pradanack, where Mullion
Island comes into view, a long way ahead. The
chance explorer here has the scene entirely to
himself: to himself and the gulls, and the bunnies
that inhabit among the bracken and grey-mottled
boulders.</p>

<p>A final stretch of cliff-tops, and you presently
are looking down upon Mullion Cove, properly
"Porthmellin," for the village of Mullion is close
upon a mile inland. "Porthmellin" means Mill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Cove. Mullion Island, a great black rock with
some real grass on it, stands <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">guardant</i>, as it were,
in advance, with other black and monstrous
rocks on either side, those over to Poldhu blacker
than their fellows; and gulls, emphasising the
blackness and their own whiteness, poise, screaming,
in air against them.</p>

<p>A smart hotel&mdash;I do not know the name of it&mdash;stands
on the headland and seems to insolently
hint that, even here, mankind has tamed the
wilds. He certainly has made the Cove, down
there, look toy-like, and the road up to Mullion
village now resembles that through some ancestral
park. But nature has provided the huge and
savage setting that makes the little enfolding
walls of the harbour, the little pool within, and
the two or three little houses, look smaller than
they really are. A general deceptiveness as to
scale pervades the Cove: the rock of Mullion
Island is, for instance, a mile in circuit, and does
not appear to be one quarter that size. But the
calm of a typical August day is the deepest
deception of all. It requires one of the autumn
equinoctial gales to reveal the innate unconquerable
savagery of the place, when a strong man
can scarce stand before the wind, and giant waves
leap over the arms of the harbour and rush,
seething and hungry for prey, up the shore.</p>

<p>There are many records of wrecks at Mullion
Cove and the cliffs between it and the Lizard.
From them I take that of a wreck on the rocks
of Mên-y-Grib = "Rock like a Comb," in 1867.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Undoubtedly the Cornish coasts have their
mysteries, but none of them is quite so mysterious
as the wreck of the Dutch barque, <em>Jonkheer Meester
Van de Wall van Puttershoek</em>, which happened on
the night of March 25th, 1867. This vessel, of
650 tons, Captain Klaas van Lammerts, homeward-bound
from the East Indies with a cargo
of sugar, coffee, spices, and tin, was worth about
£45,000, and had twenty-five persons on board.
She had been observed, the afternoon before,
beating up Channel in a gale, and it was then
noted that she was being very clumsily handled
and would perhaps not succeed in rounding the
Lizard. The wreck took place at night, and all
on board were drowned, except one man, a Greek
sailor, who was discovered the next morning,
climbing along the rocks between Polurrian and
Poldhu.</p>

<p>"My name," he said, "is Georgio Buffani.
I was seaman on board the wrecked ship, which
belonged to Dordrecht. I joined at Batavia, but
I do not know either the name of the ship or
that of the captain."</p>

<p>He repeated this extraordinary statement at
the inquest on the drowned, and being shown a
list of Dutch East Indiamen, picked out the
<em>Kosmopoliet</em>, as a likely one. The inquest therefore
was concluded on the assumption that this
was the lost vessel. The Greek then left and
was not again heard of. Soon afterwards, however,
the Dutch consul at Falmouth came with
the captains of two Dutch Indiamen then lying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
in port. One of them declared that the <em>Kosmopoliet</em>
would not be due for nearly another fortnight,
and was convinced that the lost ship was
the <em>Jonkheer</em>. The vicar of Mullion then appeared
with a fragment of flannel he had found, marked
"6 K. L." "Yes," said the captain, "it must
be the <em>Jonkheer</em>, for those are the initials of her
captain, Klaas Lammerts."</p>

<p>"On the Friday following," continues the
vicar, "when the consul and this Dutch captain
again visited Mullion, the first thing handed to
them was a parchment which had been picked
up meanwhile, and this was none other than
the masonic diploma of Klaas van Lammerts."</p>

<p>There were some curious incidents in connection
with this wreck, and the Greek sailor
himself was something of a mystery: a kind
of Jonah to ships. It was the third time, he
said, he had been wrecked, and on every occasion
was the sole survivor. It was noticed as singular
that he was wearing a lady's gold watch and
chain; and piecing one suspicious circumstance
and another together, very grave thoughts were
entertained that there had been a terrible mutiny
on board. But the secret of it was shared alone
by the Greek sailor and the sea. The coast was
thickly strewn with coffee-berries and sugar-baskets
from the cargo of the wrecked ship.
Penzance speculators who carted many tons of
coffee away, lost heavily when it was discovered
that the berries had all been spoiled by sea-water.</p>

<p>The smuggling and the wrecking that once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
distinguished Porthmellin and Mullion village
may be traced in old records: the wrecking, I
hasten to say, not of that criminal, murderous
type which produced wrecks, but the fierce
hunger for wreck of the sea which animated
all coastwise dwellers, and is still only dormant.</p>

<p>The chief smuggling incident is that of the
<em>Happy-go-Lucky</em>, an armed lugger of fourteen
guns, commanded by one Welland, of Dover.
She was located off the Cove on April 4th, 1786,
by the revenue-cutters <em>Hawk</em> and <em>Lark</em>, and
captured after a running fight in which Welland
was killed.</p>

<p>As to the "wrecking," an account, written
in 1817, tells us vividly about it.</p>

<p>"The neighbourhood is sadly infested with
wreckers. When the news of a wreck flies round
the coast, thousands of people are instantly collected
near the fatal spot; pick-axes, hatchets,
crow-bars, and ropes are their usual implements
for breaking up and carrying off whatever they
can. The moment the vessel touches the shore
she is considered fair plunder, and men, women,
and children are working on her to break her up,
night and day. The precipices they descend, the
rocks they climb, and the billows they buffet to
seize the floating fragments are the most frightful
and alarming I ever beheld; the hardships they
endure, especially the women, in winter, to save
all they can, are almost incredible. Should a
vessel, laden with wine or spirits, approach the
shore, she brings certain death and ruin to many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
with her. The rage and fighting, to stave in the
casks and bear away the spoils, in kettles and
all manner of vessels, is brutal and shocking.
To drunkenness and fighting succeed fatigue,
sleep, cold, wet, suffocation, death. Last winter
we had some dreadful scenes of this description.
A few in this neighbourhood, it seems, having a
little more light than others, had scruples against
visiting a wreck that came ashore on a Lord's
day, lest it should be breaking the Sabbath; but
they gathered all their implements into a public-house
and waited until the clock struck twelve at
midnight. Then they rushed forth; all checks of
conscience removed."</p>

<p>There is scenery here, to be explored at low
water, as fine as that of Kynance itself, if not finer.
At any rate, it is of a more stern and rugged order.
Mullion Cave is a cavern indeed, with a generous
opening and deep black depths which it is the
proper thing here to illuminate with torches, or
by the more ready, if also more evanescent,
method of lighting a newspaper.</p>

<p>Mullion village, away up inland, has a church
dedicated to St. Melyan, and some fine old bench-ends;
but Mullion is perhaps more celebrated
through Miss Mary Mundy, the "Old Inn," and
Professor Blackie.</p>

<p>Many years ago, in those days when railways
were uncommon in Cornwall, and when the comparatively
few tourists generally walked, the "Old
Inn" at Mullion was made famous. Those were
remarkable tourists in that era. You can see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
exactly what they were like by referring to old
pages of <cite>Punch</cite>, where they will be discovered,
generally pictured by John Leech, in peg-top
trousers, and wearing hats like inverted pudding-basins,
and long side-whiskers, which they were
for always pulling out, superciliously, between
finger and thumb. Things have greatly altered
since then, perhaps for the better, perhaps not.
I will not presume to say. But I do hope pudding-basins
and Dundreary whiskers (otherwise "let-us-prays")
and peg-top trousers will not come
in again.</p>

<p>Those were the times when poets and literary
men of repute, walking round the coasts, did not
disdain to write tributes in the visitors' books of
rustic inns. There were few inns and no hotels,
and visitors'-books were rarities. To-day, they
all abound, but you will seek in vain for any literature
left behind by visitors, whose tributes are
generally of the kind I observed at Land's End,
among which one person had described himself
as "King of the Cannibal Islands," and incautiously
expressed a desire to eat the donkey outside,
he felt so hungry. To this a later visitor had
added, "Cannibal indeed!"</p>

<p>Professor Blackie in 1872 made the "Old Inn"
and Mary Mundy who, with her brother, kept
it, famous. He wrote fourteen verses in her book&mdash;no
fewer than that!</p>

<p>Mary Mundy was, I believe, very proud of
them, but they just serve to show that when a
literary man, or a professional man, writes undress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
verses, so to speak, he is capable of many lines
that not only will not scan, but are also in horribly
bad taste. The patronising air, the liberty taken
with the landlady's name, are they not insufferable?
and the fleshly delight over roast duck and
cream, is it not revolting? The verses are entitled:

<p>Long ago Mary Mundy and her brother left
the "Old Inn," and at this time of writing they
are old and poor. How it came that they were
jockeyed out of their house I shall not tell here;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
they will tell it at Mullion; but those who did
it, I like to think, did not reap the reward they
expected, for the increased business looked for
has gone to the great new hotels built overlooking
the sea itself, from which Mullion is one mile
distant.</p>

AND ITS "FURRY"&mdash;PORTHLEVEN&mdash;BREAGE&mdash;WRECK
OF THE "NOISIEL"&mdash;PENGERSICK CASTLE.</span></h2>

<p>A coastguard path runs along the cliffs from
Mullion Cove, descending to the sandy shores of
Polurrian, and thence to the smaller, but still
sandy, Poldhu Cove. Enterprising builders of
hotels have erected large and florid and up-to-date
caravanserais here, and golfers have impudently
taken possession of the waste-lands. And
wireless telegraphy presides visibly over the
scene; visibly because, although wireless in one
sense, it still has taken, besides the four enormously
tall iron and steel towers that stand on
Poldhu headland, a vast quantity of interlacing
wires to form this chief among the Marconi
stations. Those great towers, with their staircases
that go winding round and round to the
dizzy summits, are an obsession, not only here, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
all over the Lizard district. You may see them
quite easily, ten miles away.</p>

<p>It is the last touch of modernity; and yet, you
know, although these towers are so ugly, they are
the visible representatives of an invisible power
of communication through the ether that is very
much more wonderful than any tales of magic ever
told in Cornwall.</p>

<p>For the other modern things in Cornwall&mdash;barrack-hotels,
golfers, "tinned" bread, and
scientific methods of dealing with the milk&mdash;there
is no excuse. Before these developments, Cornwall&mdash;save
in the matter of overmuch rain&mdash;was
near perfection.</p>

<p>The curses of modern Cornwall, from the
point of view of any one who prefers honesty,
old-fashioned ways, and the continuance of the
ancient manners and customs of the delightful
country west of the Tamar, are High Churchism,
golf, tin bungalows, huge caravanserai hotels,
and tinned bread. To these some might add
"Riviera" expresses and motor-cars, for they
are opening up, between them, the uttermost
corners of what was once a difficult land for the
tourist; and the more you do thus "open up"
Cornwall, the less like the dear delightful old
Duchy it ever becomes, and the more closely it
approximates to the cockneyfied shores nearer
London.</p>

<p>Golf is certainly the prime offender. It is a
scourge that has devastated the once beautiful
wild sandhills and coastwise heaths, and reduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
them to the titivated promenading grounds of
the wealthy bounders who generally used to
confine their energies to the unhealthy atmosphere
of the billiard-room. The newer order of things
is better for the bounders, but very bad for the
unconventional beauties of the wilds. That desolating
game is producing, here as elsewhere, a
loafer class of caddies, cockneyfying and undermining
the sturdy Cornish character, and changing
the uprising rustic youth into a loafing, cigarette-smoking
type of wastrel who becomes unemployable
and vicious when youth is left behind,
having learnt nothing but the vices of the rich,
which they have not the means to satisfy, while
they have lost, beyond recovery, the habit of
industry. It was a bad day for England when
golf crossed the Scottish border and invaded our
land.</p>

<p>Most of the other curses of Cornwall are the
direct and inevitable outcome of better local
intercommunication, and of easier travel and
the consequent increase of tourists and summer
residents. Few ever foresaw, when corrugated,
galvanised iron was introduced, how in less than
a generation the tin Bungalow and the Simple
Life would go hand in hand, and settle on the
loneliest spots to be found along our seaboard.
I will leave it for future philosophers to determine
which invented the other; whether the Bungalow
produced the Simple Life, or whether an already
existent desire for the simplification of existence
produced the Bungalow; with passing references<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
to the Servant difficulty and to that latter-day
institution, the Week-end. But it is now a well-understood
and greatly practised thing that you
may cheaply live in a tin house in the wilderness,
without servants, on tinned provisions, and on
tinned bread from the nearest machine-bakery,
and yet be in the intellectual movement of the
time, and without reproach, even though your
sanitary arrangements be such that even the old-time
cottager might consider scandalous, and
although, with the lengthening of your sojourn,
your rising zareba of empty tins makes ever
more squalid the surroundings.</p>

<p>Machine-made bread is a very real offence
and distress to any one who has known Cornwall
for a considerable number of years, for it is a
comparatively recent introduction. Until quite
lately, Cornwall was one of the last strongholds
of that admirable lady, the old-fashioned housewife
who was proud to make her own bread. She
would, dear lady, as soon thought of getting outside
help for having the beds made, as purchasing
what she would have called, with contemptuous
inflection, "Baker's bread." But nowadays not
only the resident, but the farmer even, and the
veriest cottager, gets his loaf from the baker's
cart that has now taken to calling for orders
every morning, even in rural districts, as though
they were merely London suburbs. And such
a perverted taste in bread exists that not merely
decent "baker's bread" now prevails in these
parts, but a dry, husky, leathery kind, that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
baked in tins, which Providence never intended
bread to be.</p>

<p>From Poldhu the cliffs die down for an interval
and disclose a flat shore. The little church lying
down there, on the other side of the sandy cove,
its small detached tower half built into the rocky
hillside, is that of Gunwalloe. There is no village
of Gunwalloe, and the living is held with that of
Cury, two miles inland. Scarce removed above
high-water mark, and in storms exposed in a large
degree to the fury of the waves, the lonely situation
of Gunwalloe church excites much wonder.
Legends tell with misty vagueness that it was
founded here as the result of a vow made by a
storm-tossed mariner that, should Providence
bring him safe to land, he would build a church
where he came ashore. There is not the least
reason for doubting the truth of this, and indeed
it is the only probable explanation of a church
being built on such a spot. The existing building
is a late fifteenth-century structure obviously
replacing a very early building, of which the
bowl of a Norman font is the only relic. The
usual mean and skimping restoration and refitting
with pitch-pine may be noticed here.</p>

<p>St. Winwaloe, to whom the church is dedicated,
died, in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 529, Abbot of Landevenec, in Brittany.
His life was written by Abbot Wurdestan of
that place, in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 884. "Gunwalloe" is simply a
perversion of his name, which is sometimes also
written "Guenole." A curious epitaph may be
noted, on John Dale, drowned April 1808, in
attempting the rescue of a sailor wrecked on Loe
Bar.</p>

<p>It is a disastrous sign of the times that at Cury,
and here at Gunwalloe, Ritualistic excesses are
alienating from the Church of England even those
few who have hitherto adhered to it. These
doings so angered the people a year or two back
that they threw the pictures and candles and
other Romish frippery into the sea; but the folly
of it goes on, and theatrical parties, wrongly
styled religious processions, of clergy proceed
occasionally, with pomp of vestments and swinging
of incense, to the shore, reciting prayers for
those drowned at sea, who, poor souls are quite
beyond this sort of thing. Even the bunches of
flowers the children are taught to throw into the
waves don't help them to salvation.</p>

<p>Among the many wrecks at Gunwalloe, the
story of what is called the "Dollar Wreck" stands
out most prominently. On a stormy night in
1787 a Spanish vessel struck on the cliffs by the
church and became a total loss. She had among
her cargo a great quantity of silver dollars, computed
at the lowest at seventeen tons weight.
Ever since that time the story of the "dollar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
wreck" has been kept alive, not only by tradition,
but by scattered coins being occasionally flung
upon the beach by the waves, after some exceptionally
heavy storm. Gunwalloe, in fact,
reeks with well-authenticated stories of dollars.
The earliest among these is that of a wonderful
dream by a Mrs. Jose, not long after the wreck.
She saw in the vision a heavy bag of dollars lying
on the sands, and begged her husband to go and
secure it. He laughed the idea to scorn, but she
persisted and was so in earnest about it that she
got up and dressed; and there, sure enough, lay
the bag of dollars. But just as she was rejoicing
over the find, a number of wreckers happened
along this way and seized the treasure for themselves,
quarrelling over it until they resorted to
bloodshed.</p>

<p>In 1845 a serious attempt was made to secure
the buried dollars. The position of the wreck
was located, iron stanchions were fixed in the
cliffs, and a stone dam built out to enclose the
spot, with the intention of pumping out the
water, but when those preparations were on the
eve of completion a storm came and utterly
abolished all the works. Another party of adventurers
tried, about 1865, and sank a shaft into
which the sea burst, and in 1872 a further effort
was made. The scheme of operations was on
this occasion altogether different, the idea being
to introduce pipes into the water and by powerful
pumps to suck up the sand and incidentally the
dollars. But storms made short work of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
enterprise also. Attempts are even now in progress
for the recovery of the treasure that has been
waiting over a hundred and twenty years for the
finding.</p>

<p>A mysterious wreck, not, however, so mysterious
but that it was quite certainly the result of foul
play, happened on Gunwalloe sands on April 21st,
1890. The steamship <em>Brankelow</em>, from Cardiff
for Cronstadt, with a cargo of 3,000 tons of coal,
ran at full speed ahead at midnight on to the
sands. Fortunately it was not rough weather
at the time, and the crew were got off safely,
although it was stated that they were all drunk.
The cause of the vessel being driven directly for
the land was found to have been a malicious
tampering with the compasses by Trades' Union
men at Cardiff, and by violent damage done
wilfully to it on the voyage. Two magnets had
been inserted at Cardiff, by which the needle was
wrong to the extent of five points. The <em>Brankelow</em>
eventually became embedded in the sand
and was a total loss.</p>

<p>Up out of Gunwalloe the road skirts Halzaphron
Cliffs, and thence descends to the sands of
Loe Bar. At Halzaphron on November 4th, 1807,
the ill-fated <em>Susan and Rebecca</em> transport, homeward-bound
from Buenos Aires, was wrecked.
Of the 180 on board, forty-one were drowned and
buried on the cliff-top. H.M.S. <em>Anson</em> took the
sands on Loe Bar, December 28th, 1807, and was
wrecked, with the loss of her captain and sixty
sailors.</p>

<img src="images/i_221.jpg" width="600" height="208" alt="" />
<div class="caption">LOOE POOL.</div>
</div>

<p>Loe, or properly Looe, Bar is a belt of sand
thrown up by the sea, obstructing the outflow of
a stream called the Cober, which has too feeble a
discharge to clear away the obstruction, causing
the valley running two miles and a half inland to
Helston to assume the aspect of a lake. In the
summer these waters would to some degree percolate
through the sand, but in the winter's rains
they could not escape so quickly, and consequently
the level of Looe Pool would rise by some ten
feet or more, a source of some inconvenience.
From this arose an ancient custom, by which the
corporation of Helston presented the lord of the
manor with a leathern purse containing three-halfpence,
soliciting permission to cut the sandbar
and so permit the water to escape. Permission
graciously accorded, workmen were engaged who
cut a trench in the sand, and so the stream burst
through and regained its summer level. This
done, the sea began to choke up the outlet as
before, and the process was repeated the next
winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>This quaint old custom is now a thing of the
past, it having been of recent years somewhat
belatedly realised that a culvert constructed under
Looe Bar would effectually drain the waters off,
without the periodic cuttings.</p>

<p>But Cornwall being the Cornwall of legends,
it was known perfectly well that satanic agency
and not natural forces originally produced Looe
Bar. Time was, according to these legends,
when Helston was a thriving port, with trading
vessels sailing up the estuary. It was Tregeagle
who did the mischief. Every one in Cornwall has
heard of Tregeagle, the dishonest steward, who
pervades many legends and lives in many centuries,
these stories not being particular in the
matter of ten centuries or so. Set to work by
St. Petroc at Gunwalloe, his task was to carry
sand in sacks across the mouth of the estuary and
empty them at Porthleven. Laden with a sack
of enormous size, the doomed spirit was wading
across when one of the wicked demons, who were
always on the watch for him, tripped him up, and
the contents of the sack fell into the sea.</p>

<p>Helston is nowadays a quiet, uninteresting
town, by no means looking its age. It was in
existence at the time of the Norman Conquest,
for it appears in Domesday Book as "Henlistone."
Of its castle, as likewise of its old-time Parliamentary
importance of returning two members,
nothing is left; and only once a year does Helston
advertise its existence to the world, when its
annual Furry, held on May 8th, is duly chronicled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
in the newspapers. It attracted more attention
in 1907, because that was the year of Sir William
Treloar, a native of Helston, being Lord Mayor of
London; and the sun shone that day on the unwonted
spectacle of a Lord Mayor jigging down
the principal street of Helston in the Furry
Dance:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">"With Hal-an-tow, Rumbelow!</div>
<div class="verse indentbase">For we are up as soon as any, O,</div>

<div class="verse indentbase">The summer and the may, O!</div>
<div class="verse indentbase">For summer is acome,</div>
<div class="verse indentbase">And winter is agone."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Such is the chorus of the Furry Song, sung to
an immemorially ancient tune. The Furry, which
some hold to be a survival of the Roman "Floralia,"
and is obviously in any case a celebration in
honour of spring, is observed with great earnestness
and is officially recognised by the Mayor and
Corporation of Helston, who take active part in it.</p>

<p>The woods of Penrose descend beautifully to
the shares of Looe Pool, and they are exchanged
with some regret for the not very interesting
cliff-road on to Porthleven, a small harbour town,
situated on steep hillsides overlooking a pool.
Granite is shipped at the quays, and much yacht-
and boat-building is carried on. Inland is
Breage, a village lying just off the modern high-road
between Helston and Penzance, and suffering
from the fact that it has thus been shouldered
aside, in the deviation of traffic. You may perceive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
in the following lines, the pronunciation of
the place-name:</p>

<p>The church is dedicated to a woman-saint,
Breaca, one of the band of Irish missionaries who
landed at Hayle River. It is a large and fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
building. A prominent feature of the interior is
a fresco, discovered of late years, representing the
Saviour as the benefactor of all callings. The
almost nude figure, ten feet high, is crowned.
Gouts of blood, like crows' feet or broad-arrow
marks in shape, are plentifully distributed over
body and limbs, and all around are shown some
fifty articles of handicraft, including scythe, rake,
saw, trowel, plumber's iron, harp, zither, pitcher,
cart, plate, sickle, axe, anchor, anvil, and horseshoe,
all connected with the figure by spurts of
blood, typifying the blood of Christ crucified
sanctifying all callings. The wheel on which the
figure stands seems to typify eternity. A similar
fresco has already been noted at Poundstock.</p>

<p>The coast from Porthleven offers no exceptional
features until after passing Trewavas Head,
when the smooth expanse of Praa Sands is seen.</p>

<p>Here the iron barque <em>Noisiel</em>, of Plymouth,
was driven ashore in a storm on the night of
Friday, August 4th, 1905, and became a total
wreck. She was on her way from Cherbourg with
600 tons of armour-plate, and weathered Rinsey
Head only to become embayed off Praa Sands.
Anchors were let out, but failed to hold on the
sandy bottom, and the <em>Noisiel</em> was driven in,
broadside on, and the waves speedily broke her
back. The crew mostly jumped overboard and
struck out for the shore. Two of the nine aboard
were drowned. The vessel was a total loss.
Some of the armour-plates still remain, half
buried in the sand.</p>

<p>A little way onward and a quarter of a mile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
inland is the fine old embattled tower of Pengersick
Castle. It stands in a pleasant meadow,
and is now part of a "farm-place." The tower
is of comparatively late date, and seems to have
been built in the reign of Henry the Eighth under
mysterious circumstances, by a person named
Millaton. We need not believe the tale that he
had committed a murder in some distant shire,
and hid himself here, building the tower for
defence, in the event of justice nosing him; for
the arrival of a stranger and the hasty building
of a defensible tower would at once have attracted
undesirable curiosity. Moreover, the masonry
is of such exquisite fineness that it is quite evident
it was only built at leisure and by the most skilled
of craftsmen. Millaton is further said to have
lived here with his wife an unhappy existence.
They hated one another to extinction; but at
last he pretended a reconciliation and planned an
elaborate dinner to celebrate the event. After
dinner he raised his glass, in a toast, and drained
it off. She followed suit. Then said she: "Yours
was poisoned, and in three minutes you will be a
dead man!"</p>

<p>"So was yours," he rejoined, "and you will
be a dead woman in five minutes!"</p>

<p>"No matter for that," replied his wife, "for
I shall have two minutes left, in which to kick
your dead body!"</p>

<p>Germoc lies just inland from this place. Its
church, in a hollow beneath the high-road, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
dedicated to St. Germoch, another of the Irish
saints. "St. Germoe's Chair," a canopied stone
building, stands in the churchyard. The corbel-stones
of the south porch are carved with figures
of monkeys.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="smallfont">PRUSSIA COVE AND ITS SMUGGLERS&mdash;PERRANUTHNOE&mdash;ST.
HILARY&mdash;MARAZION&mdash;ST. MICHAEL'S
MOUNT&mdash;LUDGVAN&mdash;GULVAL</span></h2>

<p>I had for long years wished to come to Prussia
Cove, but for one reason and another had always
fallen short of it. If you are staying, for example,
at Penzance, Prussia Cove is a little beyond your
ken; and if Lizard Town or Mullion is your
headquarters, then again the place is remote.
Therein you perceive at once a survival of its
ancient solitary and out-of-the-way situation,
which made the place an ideal smugglers' resort.
For Prussia Cove is famous above all other places
in Cornwall in smuggling annals. Not, mark
you, the mere legendary smuggling tales, but
sheer matter-of-fact details about the shy industry:
details that are so hard to come by;
facts for which the historian of smuggling cries
aloud, and rarely gets. There are two coves:
Prussia Cove, originally named Porth Leah, and
Bessie's Cove, separated from one another only by
a projecting reef. Bessie, who gave her name to
the westerly of the two inlets, was one Bessie
Burrow, who kept an inn called the "Kidleywink,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
on the cliff-top. "Kidleywink" was not precisely
the sign of the house: it appears to have
been an old slang Cornish term for a public-house.</p>

<p>The "King of Prussia" who imposed that title
upon the erstwhile Porth Leah was not in the
first instance Frederick the Great, but John
Carter, the eldest of a family of that name who
were settled here in the eighteenth century.
Among the eight Carter brothers and two sisters,
children of one Francis Carter, miner and small
farmer, who died in 1784, we hear in detail only
of the three brothers, John, Henry, and Charles.
Ostensibly all small farmers and fisherfolk, they
were really smugglers on an extensive scale;
"free-traders" in a bold and open way, greatly
respected round about by all the squires and
considerable people who knew them. They had,
each one of them, the reputation of being honest
men who would touch nothing that was not their
own, and sold excellent cognac, hollands, and other
articles at fair prices. Very well thought-of men,
I assure you, with whom some "great men,"
darkly hinted at, did not disdain to enter into
partnership.</p>

<p>John Carter took his nickname of "King
of Prussia" from the boyish games of "King
of the Castle" in which he and his brothers
used to fleet their youth away, and the name
stuck to him in after life, as often is the way
with great and celebrated personages. Even so,
Dickens, the "Boses" (for Moses) of his and his
brothers' games, became "Boz"; and Louisa de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
la Ramée, who as a baby lisped her name,
"Ouida," became in after years famous in that
signature. So the "King of Prussia," <em>i.e.</em> John
Carter, is in good company. In 1770 he built a
substantial stone house on the cliffs, and appears
to have used it in part as a residence, partly as a
store for smuggled goods, and in some degree as
an inn (I fear quite unlicensed) known as the
"King of Prussia." There he lived until 1806,
and from a small battery he had constructed he
had the impudence to fire on one occasion upon
the <em>Fairy</em> revenue sloop, which had chased a
smuggling craft into the cove and had sent in a
boat-party. The boat retreated, and notice being
given to the collector of customs at Penzance, a
military force was despatched to reduce his fort,
by taking it in the rear. The smugglers retreated
to the "Kidleywink" and the soldiers then left
for Penzance, perhaps having demolished Carter's
emplacements.</p>

<p>Elsewhere than in Cornwall all these things
would have produced bloodshed; but nothing
more seems to have been said about the affair,
which is delightfully, entirely, and characteristically
Cornish; own cousin to Irish escapades, just
as the Cornish might, if they cared to do so, even
call cousins with the Irish themselves.</p>

<p>Of Charles Carter we hear little, but of Henry&mdash;"Captain
Harry"&mdash;a good deal. He had many
adventures; was "wanted" by the excise and
fled to America; returned and recommenced
adventurous smuggling voyages to Roscoff in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Brittany; was made prisoner of war in France,
and then settled as agent for his brothers in
Roscoff. He had all his life been troubled by
the qualms of religious fear, and had in 1789
become converted. In after years he retired and
lived in a small way as a farmer in the neighbouring
hamlet of Rinsey, where he died in 1829. He
wrote his Autobiography, a human document of
singular interest, and preached fervently while
still actively a smuggler, doubling the parts of
saint and sinner in the most extraordinary way;
entirely without suspicion of false dealing. He
feared God and failed to honour the King, in the
important respect of chousing him out of his
inland revenue as far as it was possible for him
to do. He lived respected and died lamented.
I have had occasion to refer to him at length
elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> and I have no doubt that, according
to his lights, he was an entirely honest
man.</p>

<p>Prussia Cove at the present time of writing is
a place wholly uninteresting. The "King of
Prussia's" house was pulled down in 1906, and a
new road is on the site of it. Caverns, said, of
course, to have been the Carters' storehouses,
yawn darkly in the low cliffs, above high-water
mark. A barbed-wire squalor abounds along the
winding road, and through the garden of an
uninviting residence you come down to Bessie's
Cove and the dark rocks going sheer into the
water; always with "Trespassers will be Prosecuted"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
staring you in the face from makeshift
posts and notice-boards.</p>

<p>Going up out of the region of these singular
developments, I met a man raking over some
stones recently placed in the road: a good-looking
man, with a beard and an indefinable air of being
a retired officer of the Royal Navy. He asked
what I wanted there, a question I thought impudent;
but giving the inoffensive answer that I
had been seeking Prussia Cove, the scene of Carter,
the smuggler's activities, and could not find
Carter's house, he replied that he thought people
coming to see the place for that reason was sheer
morbidness.</p>

<p>"How so?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said he, "all that kind of thing is
past and done away with; and besides, I've had
the house pulled down; and this is a private
road."</p>

<p>"Oh!" I rejoined, "the deuce it is, and you
have! Who does it belong to, then?"</p>

<p>"To me; but don't you trouble about that.
Go just where you like."</p>

<p>I told him, as nicely as possible, that this was
precisely what I intended to do; and then this
apparently contradictory but not unamiable person
began to dilate upon the want of respect the
Cornish had for antiquity. The text for this
was the cantankerous nature of two old maiden
ladies, who jointly owned an old wayside smithy
on the high road between Ashtown and Germoe.
When one had agreed to sell it to my informant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
if he could obtain her sister's consent, he went to
the other sister with the proposition.</p>

<p>"What does my sister say?" she asked.</p>

<p>"She agrees."</p>

<p>"Then I won't!"</p>

<p>And as neither would agree upon anything
concerning it, the building was unsold and went
tenantless. Thenceforward, it fell into disrepair,
and eventually fell down altogether.</p>

<p>Laughing at this ridiculous, but true, story, I
went my way. I discovered afterwards that the
narrator of it was the locally famous Mr. Behrens,
who has purchased the land in and about Prussia
Cove and has figured in some bitterly fought
right-of-access cases here.</p>

<p>The headland beyond Prussia Cove, forming
the eastern horn of Mount's Bay, is Cuddan
Point. The meaning of "Cuddan" is said to be
dark, or gloomy, but there is nothing exceptionally
so in this not very striking point, and the
autumn corn-fields render the approach to it even
cheerful. But there is nothing gained by toiling
to its extremity. The embattled granite house
looking over Mount's Bay from hence is known
as Acton Castle. From it the coastline can be
plainly seen for miles.</p>

<p>Whichever way you go, by cliffs or by the
high road, to Perranuthnoe, the way is extremely
dull, and Perranuthnoe&mdash;now called locally merely
"Perran"&mdash;is a dull little village. According to a
wild legend, it was to the shore by Perranuthnoe
that an ancestor of the Trevelyans came on horseback<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
from the submerged land of Lyonesse
between Land's End and Scilly. The roaring
waters that had engulfed that fabled land and
its 140 churches could not keep pace with his
marvellous steed.</p>

<p>The scenery has for several miles past been
distinctly inferior in interest and beauty to that
of Mount's Bay and westward; but as it is the
most truistic of truisms that every eye forms its
own beauty, there may conceivably be those who
can find it otherwise. The proof, or disproof,
of the assertion lies with the explorer; he is a
poor creature that takes his opinions ready-made.</p>

<p>Regaining the dull high road from Perranuthnoe,
the very considerable village of Marazion is
met, fringing the highway. There is very much
more of Marazion than those who look at it from
below would suppose, but as the view <em>from</em> Marazion
is infinitely better than any view <em>of</em> it, there
need be no curiosity cherished by Penzance
visitors looking eastward, as to what is there,
immediately over the shoulder of the hill, beyond
the Mount. Yet, if there can be no interest in
Marazion, there is plenty of the antiquarian kind
in its parish church of St. Hilary, over a mile
distant, away back in a north-easterly direction,
in a lonely situation off the road. It was in 1853
that the body of the church was burnt down,
with the exception of the Early English tower,
with stone spire, remarkable in Cornwall, where
spires are rare. In the rebuilt church, removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
from the churchyard, now stands the famous
"Constantine stone," inscribed</p>

<p class="center smallfont">
IMP . CAES . FLAV . VAL . CONSTANTINO . PIO .<br />
CAES . NOB . DIVI . CONSTANTI . PII . AVG . FILIO.<br />
</p>

<p>Rendered in full, this, the longest Romano-British
inscription in Cornwall,
becomes a dedication to the Emperor
Constantine the Great. The
date has been fixed at <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 307.
The stone was perhaps a milestone,
but there is very much
more about the ruling monarch
than modern travellers would
welcome, and if there was ever
a mileage inscription as well, it
has wholly disappeared. It will
probably be conceded by all that
in the matter of milestones, at any
rate, we are superior to the
Romans. It is a somewhat curious
coincidence that a contemporary
milestone has in recent years
been discovered at Tintagel, bearing
an inscription to Licinius, co-ruler with
Constantine.</p>

<div class="caption">THE "NOTI-NOTI
STONE," ST. HILARY.</div>
</div>

<p>A more mysterious stone exists at St. Hilary.
This is the well-known but imperfectly understood
"Noti-Noti stone" a seven-foot long block
of granite, inscribed with those two words and six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
not very distinct symbols supposed to represent
masonic tools. Some antiquaries are disposed to
regard it as the tombstone of an unknown Notus,
the son of Notus; but the meaning is quite uncertain.</p>

<p>But to return to Marazion, where another
insoluble problem awaits us and wordy warfare
continually rages around the derivation of the
place-name. It was once alternatively, in the
local speech, "Market Jew," and thus arose
the popular legend that the Jews anciently
established here a market for tin. But it seems
reasonable to suppose that "Market Jew" was
only a corruption, by people who had almost
wholly forgotten the now extinct Cornish language,
of the Cornish words <i lang="kw" xml:lang="kw">marghasiou</i>, signifying
"markets." Those "Jews" are supposed to
have really been Ph&oelig;nician traders. A further
theory, that the name derived from <i lang="kw" xml:lang="kw">Margha-ziawn</i>,
meaning "market-strand," deserves consideration.
But whatever may be the truth,
there is no doubt that here was situated a tin-smeltery
in very remote times, for in 1849 the
ruins of such a building were discovered. The
Marazion people styled it, of course, the "Jews'
House," and some of the "Jews' House tin"
found there is to be seen in the museum at Penzance.
A great deal of ingenuity, unsupported by
any real evidence, has been employed in attempts
to solve the meaning of the place-name, and it
has been put forward that the spot was originally
inhabited by a colony of Jews, who handed down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the bitterness of their exile by styling it "Mara-Zion,"
<em>i.e.</em> "Bitter Zion." Still another theory
has been advanced, namely that St. Michael's
Mount was the original Marazion, from the Hebrew,
"marath-aiyin," "the landmark"; the Mount
being the most prominent object for many miles
out to sea. So it will be perceived that there
is no lack of choice.</p>

<p>Coming down the long street of Marazion to
the shores of Mount's Bay, the most remarkable
scene in Cornwall opens out before you. There
stretch the flat curving shores of the bay, fringed
with sands, but for the most part solitary, with
the last miles of the Great Western Railway
running along the levels, just above high-water
mark; and Penzance town showing white in the
distance, three miles away. There are more
beautiful bays in Cornwall, and better sands, and
repose rather than ruggedness is the note of the
scene; but the great distinguishing feature of
Mount's Bay&mdash;the feature that gives the bay
its name&mdash;is St. Michael's Mount, rising majestically
in the sea off Marazion, half a mile distant
from the mainland, with its castle and priory,
now the residence of Lord St. Levan, cresting the
rocky pyramid with a coronet of towers and
pinnacles. St. Michael's Mount is an inspiring
sight, whether you are in expectation of seeing
it or not. But nothing is unexpected in the way
of scenery nowadays. You know what lies round
every bend of the road. If we could only recapture
the unexpected, how fine that would be!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>But, whether you first see St. Michael's Mount
at high tide, when it is an island, or at the ebb,
when it is joined to the land by half a mile of
slimy, seaweedy causeway, it is grand.</p>

<p>At the same time, I like best to think of St.
Michael's Mount as I first saw it, on first coming
into Cornwall. I had come by train from Paddington,
and the day had long given place to
night. The weary train pulled up for the ticket-taking
at Marazion Road, and in the quiet interval
the wind boomed about the station buildings,
and the wash of the waves could be plainly heard
on the sands. Eagerly one looked out upon the
night for a possible glimpse of the famous Mount,
and there indeed, guided by a twinkling light so
high that it looked like a star, the eye saw vaguely
a monstrous pyramidal bulk, a something darker
than the surrounding darkness. "It is the
Mount," I said, and a thrill of romantic delight
possessed me.</p>

<p>Well, you know, St. Michael's Mount is 231
feet in height. It is no mean altitude, and the
rise is so sharp up its sides that one need not be
of the Falstaff kind, fat and scant of breath, to
find the climbing it something tiring on a hot day.
But St. Michael's Mount the next morning was a
less impressive object than that darkling glimpse
gave warranty for. It was inevitable. Just as
the impression overnight had been finer than
expected, so the reality suffered. But ordinarily
St. Michael's Mount does not disappoint; always
with this proviso, that you do not see its bigger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
brother, Mont St. Michel, on the coast of
Normandy, first.</p>

<p>An ingenious eighteenth-century writer remarked
of St. Michael's Mount that "it seemed
emblematic of a well-ordered State, its base being
devoted to Trade and Commerce, its sides to the
service of the country, and its summit to the
glory of God." By "trade and commerce" he
indicated the little village and harbour at the
foot of the Mount, and the reference to the glory
of God was of course an allusion to the remains
of the Abbey, but what he could have meant by
"the service of the country" I cannot tell, unless
by any chance it was an allusion to the ineffectual
popgun battery mounted on the crags.</p>

<p>The history of St. Michael's Mount begins like
most history, in uncertainties. It is supposed&mdash;and
much criticism has not destroyed the supposition&mdash;that
it is the place called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Iktis</i>, referred
to by Posidonius, who travelled in Britain during
the first century before the Christian era. He
spoke of the "little islands called Cassiterides,
lying off the coast of Iberia," from which much
tin was obtained, and then mentioned the isle of
Iktis, in Britain. It is quite clear, therefore, that
the supposition that by the Cassiterides he meant
the Scilly Islands, or any islands in Britain, must
be baseless. They were what we know as the
Balearic Islands, off the coast of Spain, the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Iberia</i> of the ancients. But in other writers we
find the Cassiterides to indicate tin islands in
general.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>Diodorus Siculus, who was contemporary with
Julius Cæsar, and wrote a <cite>Universal History</cite>, a
considerable undertaking for one man even then,
appears to have copied a good many of the statements
made by Posidonius, in addition to having
described places seen in his own travels. He is
not always regarded as a reliable authority,
but there seems no reason to doubt the essential
truth of his statements. Referring to "Belerion,"
otherwise Cornwall, he says: "The inhabitants
of that extremity of Britain both excel in hospitality
and also, by reason of their intercourse
with foreign merchants, are civilised in their
mode of life. These people prepare the tin,
working very skilfully the earth which produces
it. The ground is rocky, but has in it earthy
veins, the produce of which is wrought down
and melted and purified. Then, when they
have cast it in the form of dice-shaped cubes,
they carry it into a certain island adjoining
Britain, and called Iktis. For, during the recess
of the tide, the intervening space is left dry,
and they carry over abundance of tin to this
place in their carts. And there is something
peculiar in the islands of these parts lying between
Europe and Britain, for at the full tide the intervening
passage being overflowed, they appear
islands, but when the sea retires, a large space
is left dry, and they are seen as peninsulas.
From them the merchants purchase the tin of
the natives and transport it into Gaul, and finally,
travelling through Gaul on foot, in about thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
days they bring their burdens on horses to the
mouth of the river Rhone."</p>

<p>That Diodorus should refer to "islands," rather
than the one island that becomes a peninsula at
low water, has been held as a proof that he knew
nothing at first hand about this coast, but it may
well be that in the changes known to have taken
place here, other islands have disappeared. Quite
apart from the fantastic legends of the lost land of
Lyonesse between Scilly and the Land's End,
where the lone waters, empty except for a few
intervening reefs, now roll, it is quite certain
that at some early period what is now Mount's
Bay was a forest. Hunt, in his "Popular Romances
of the West of England," tells us&mdash;not
romancing: "I have passed in a boat from St.
Michael's Mount to Penzance on a summer day,
when the waters were very clear and the tide low,
and seen the black masses of trees in the white
sands, extending far out into the bay. On one
occasion, while I was at school at Penzance,
after a violent equinoctial gale, large trunks of
trees were thrown up on the shore, just beyond
Chyandour, and then with the other boys I went
at the lowest of the tide, far out over the sands,
and saw scores of trees embedded in the sands.
We gathered nuts&mdash;they were beech-nuts&mdash;and
leaves in abundance." I, too, have found, cast
upon the shore, traces of this submarine forest.</p>

<p>Now it is a curious thing, in this connection,
that, among the various names by which St.
Michael's Mount has been known, including the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
earliest of all, "Din-Sûl," or the "Fortress of the
Sun," is that of <i lang="kw" xml:lang="kw">Carregloose-in-coes</i>, which, spelled
in slightly different ways, means the Hoar Rock
(that is to say the grey rock) in the Wood. "Coes"
appears to have been a form of the early British
"coed," for woodland. The town of Cowes,
for example, in the Isle of Wight, takes its name
from the woodlands that once occupied its site.
St. Michael's Mount was once, therefore, a part
of the mainland, and if we observe, still further,
that the Chapel Rock on the approach to it, and
the great pyramidal form of the Mount itself are
hard greenstone and granite, resting upon slate
and clay, we shall see exactly why they remain
whence all other land has disappeared.</p>

<p>That foreigners, in times long before the
Romans came to Britain, were accustomed to
resort to this neighbourhood for tin has already
been shown, and that they were Ph&oelig;nicians is
certain. Many people dismiss the Ph&oelig;nicians as
a people almost as mythical as the ph&oelig;nix itself,
but they were the earliest maritime traders.
They were the people who founded Carthage, and
they penetrated to the ends of the known world.
Also they were of a strongly marked Semitic, or
Jewish type; and thus ancient Cornish traditions
about "the Jews" are well based on facts.</p>

<p>As "St. Michael's" Mount the island became
early known. At some uncertain time the Archangel
is said to have appeared here to some
hermits, and the place was therefore already holy
when St. Keyne came from Ireland in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 490<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
and visited it. Edward the Confessor, in the
eleventh century, granted St. Michael's Mount
to the Benedictine Abbey of Mont St. Michel
in Normandy, and until the reign of Henry the
Fifth it remained the property of that Abbey,
with a priory established on its summit. It
was then transferred to the Abbey of Sion, in
Middlesex.</p>

<p>The Abbey of Mont St. Michel and the Priory
of St. Michael's Mount were fortresses, as well as
religious establishments. The monks had fortified
themselves for their own protection, and
the strongholds seemed so useful to men of strife
that we early find St. Michael's Mount seized
and held by them when trouble was brewing.
Thus, when Richard Lion-heart was a prisoner
abroad, one Henry de Pomeroy got possession
of the Mount on behalf of John. But when
Richard, contrary from all reasonable expectation,
returned, the position became untenable,
the garrison yielded, and Pomeroy opened one of
his veins and bled himself to death; a more
excellent way than reserving himself for the
picturesque and long-drawn agonies that in those
times were the penalty of high treason.</p>

<p>A more desperate affair was that of 1471,
when the Earl of Oxford, and a party of fugitives
from the Yorkist crowning mercy at Barnet,
fled from the vengeance of Edward the Fourth and
took possession of the Mount. They came as
pilgrims. You may quite easily picture them
coming to the shore, pausing a moment at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Chapel Rock, then with a chapel on it; and
thence walking the causeway to the Mount,
kissing the relics at the foot of it, praying at the
two wayside crosses up its steep sides and then
admitted to the Priory itself, where, with drawn
swords, produced from beneath their travel-stained
pilgrims' garb, they soon made themselves
masters of the place. Sir John Arundell, sheriff
of Cornwall, was sent to dislodge them, and was
after several attacks slain on the sands. According
to the received account, Edward the
Fourth pardoned the Earl of Oxford, on account
of his so gallantly defending himself here; but
we may well suppose that he "pardoned" him
because he could not by other means dislodge
this valorous rebel.</p>

<p>The Priory became a sanctuary for Lady
Catherine Gordon, wife of Perkin Warbeck, in
the time of Henry the Seventh, but sanctuaries
were generally violated, and this was no exception.
She was dragged out and sent to London.</p>

<p>During the west-country rebellion against
the reformed religion in 1549, the Priory having
by that time been dissolved and the property
granted to the Arundells of Lanherne, Humphrey
Arundell held it for the rebels. It was taken
and retaken in the fights that followed, and
Arundell at last was captured and put to death.
The last warlike operations at St. Michael's
Mount were the defence by the Royalist, Sir
Francis Basset, and the capture by Colonel
Hammond, on behalf of the Parliament. Since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
1660 it has been the property of the St. Aubyn
family.</p>

</div>

<p>The village at the foot of the Mount, with its
little harbour, occupies a humble feudal situation
beneath the castle of my Lord St. Levan. If
you would seek revived mediævalism in a democratic
age, then St. Michael's Mount is the place
to find it, for Lord St. Levan maintains a body
of gorgeously liveried boatmen to row him across,
to and from his island hold; and nowadays,
instead of being free to ramble about the craggy
sides of the Mount, the stranger must resign himself
to a guide. Whether wanton mischief on
the part of holiday-makers, or the scattering
of sandwich-papers, has aught to do with this
changed condition of affairs, or whether it is merely
due to the increased consideration the St. Aubyns
cherish for themselves since the barony of St.
Levan was conferred upon the family in 1887, I
will not pretend to say.</p>

<p>The interior of the castellated residence is of
somewhat varied interest. The chapel, although
originally of Perpendicular architecture, was so
altered in the "restoration" of 1826 that it is
now merely a melancholy example of what was
in those days considered to be Gothic. It is chill
and bare and quite without any feature of note,
with the exception of one thing that, being just a
hole in the floor, can scarce be described as a
"feature." This is an <em>oubliette</em>, discovered during
the works of 1826.</p>

<p>Romantic novelists have been largely responsible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
for a general indifference to the very
real mysteries and tragedies of ancient buildings,
and the public, unable to distinguish between
fact and fiction, have agreed to look upon everything
out of the common as fiction. Yet here,
the workmen of some eighty years ago, removing
the old woodwork, discovered a walled-up door
in the south wall, and, opening it, a narrow flight
of stone steps was revealed, leading down into
a grim stone cell, six feet square, without any
window or other opening than the door by which
they had entered. They were horrified by stumbling
in the darkness of that dreadful place upon
what proved to be the skeleton of a man of extraordinary
height. Who that unfortunate wretch
was, flung into this living tomb, to be conveniently
"forgotten" and to die of starvation, has never
been discovered. The appalling cynicism that
constructed this particular example of an <em>oubliette</em>
beneath the chapel floor is worthy of remark.
While the doomed man lay there, above him
the pious castellan and his fellow-villains were
praising God.</p>

<p>The Chevy Chase Hall, a room formerly the
refectory of the Priory, but remodelled in the
seventeenth century, is a small apartment with
timber roof. The name now given it refers to a
curious plaster frieze representing hunting scenes.
The Tower is the oldest portion of the buildings,
rising to a total height of 250 feet from the sea.
A projecting granite framework, looking out from
the south-west angle of the battlements, is known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
popularly as "St. Michael's Chair." It is really
the frame of an ancient lantern, beacon, or cresset,
lighted in former times to guide the fishing-boats
safely into harbour; but a legend has obtained
currency that any sweetheart, or husband, or wife,
first taking a seat in it will be "master for life."
It is not a difficult matter to edge into the "chair,"
but it requires rather more agility, and a cool
head, to return. In spite of this, very many
women do perform the act; which shows at
once their superstition and the real keenness they
have to obtain the upper hand. But at the same
time, it may not inaptly be supposed that, to any
contemplative and philosophical man, the spectacle
of his chosen one attempting the hazardous feat
will be something in the nature of a danger-signal.
If the loved one be now ready to risk a broken neck
for this supposed advantage, what, he might
suppose, will be his chance of happiness?</p>

<p>The church-tower peeping over the hill-top
on the right hand, as you proceed along the dull
flat road to Penzance is that of Ludgvan, and
the marshes are those of Ludgvan Leaze. Ludgvan
church, although an extremely blue-mouldy
edifice, is not without interest and has a particularly
good tower. Moreover, there are tablets
in it to the memory of the Davy family, of whom
the celebrated Sir Humphry, born at Penzance
in 1778, is the most notable. Dr. Borlase, who
may be described as the father of Cornish arch&aelig;ology,
was rector here for fifty-two years, and
died in 1772. A well in Ludgvan has, by ancient
tradition, the curious property of insuring whosoever
drinks of its water from being hanged.
It may be testimony to the law-abiding character
of the Ludgvan people that they do not set much
store by the virtues of their well; but at the same
time they are somewhat sly humorists, as perhaps
any stranger not duly forewarned may discover,
on asking if there is anything of interest in the
place. "Oh! yes," you are likely to hear; and
then comes the story of the well and an urgent
invitation to drink of it, by way of insurance.
The origin of this legend is altogether unknown,
but may be an entirely distorted recollection of
some special property connected with a holy well
of St. Lidgean, one of the numerous Irish saints
of Cornwall, whose name survives in that of the
village.</p>

<p>Behind Ludgvan, rising to a height of 765 feet,
is the hill of Castell-an-Dinas, not perhaps so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
a hill as a culmination of the downs stretching
between the north coast of Cornwall and the
south, a distance from sea to sea of only five
miles between Marazion and Hayle, and between
Penzance and St. Ives of only seven miles. From
the hill-top both the Bristol and the English
Channels can at once be seen. Castell-an-Dinas
is a prehistoric camp, with a modern roughly
constructed stone tower, locally known as "Roger's
Tower," in its midst. It seems to have been
built about the time when one "J. H., aged
63" was buried, in 1823. This person, together
with three others of his family who died in 1812,
lie within a little walled enclosure on the hillside.
He had some dispute with the vicar of Gulval,
and so refused to allow any of his family to be
buried in the churchyard. Something of a key
to his sentiments will be found in the inscriptions
within the enclosure: "Custom is the idol of
fools," and "Virtue only consecrates this ground."</p>

<p>As Penzance is approached, Gulval appears on
the right, its church-tower glimpsed from amid
its surrounding trees. The flat fields are devoted
to the cultivation of broccoli, and early vegetables,
fruits, and flowers for the London market. The
saint whose name is hidden in that of Gulval is
said to be Wulvella, a Welshwoman, sister of
St. Pol de Leon to whom the church of Paul
near Mousehole, is dedicated. It is also said
to indicate St. Godwald, a sixth-century Welsh
bishop-hermit.</p>

<p>Gulval is one of the prettiest churchyards in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Cornwall, beautiful with subtropical plants and
pampas grass. Behind Gulval, on the little Trevaylor
brook, is Bleu Bridge, a footbridge only
remarkable for a tall granite pillar at one end,
inscribed lengthways <span class="smcap">QVENATAVCI ICDINVI FILIVS</span>.</p>

<p>Penzance is reached past the fringe of houses
called Chyandour, on the level, approaching the
railway station, where the Trevaylor brook enters
the sea. "Chyandour" means "the house by
the water," and probably marks the site of a
prehistoric settlement of tin-streamers. Tin-smelting
works are now situated on the brook.</p>

<p>Penzance is 279-1/2 miles from Hyde Park Corner,
London, by road, and 305-1/4 miles by Great Western
Railway. Until some ten years ago, when the
Great Western adopted a shorter route, and cut
off some of the generous curves with which
Brunel had endowed the Cornish portion of the
line, the mileage was 328. The name, originally
spelled "Pen Sans," and still pronounced so,
means Holy Head, or Headland, but there is some
uncertainty as to the precise significance. A
chapel dedicated to St. Anthony once stood on
the bold bluff by the harbour, where the not very
satisfactory church of St. Mary, built in 1834, is
now situated; and it may have been from this
sainted headland that the place-name derived.
But for long centuries the Holy Head has been
thought that of St. John the Baptist, and when
in 1614 Penzance adopted a borough seal, it was
the head of the Baptist on a charger they selected
for the town's device. The old springtime festival,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
held from distant centuries in the streets of the
town, takes place on the eve of St. John the
Baptist, and on the eve of St. Peter.</p>

<p>Penzance is by no means a parasite seaside
town, existing only for and on visitors. It is a
busy market-town all the year round, with a
considerable harbour. The long straight thoroughfare
of Market Jew Street,
rising steadily to the Market
House, which is the centre of
Penzance, is a street of shops.
The Market House is a rather
gloomy granite building, with
a cupola that bulks out conspicuously
in distant views
and stands for Penzance. Indeed,
in reminiscences of the
place you do not so much as think of the sea-front
as of this extraordinary municipal building,
that shows the ideas of Ionic architecture prevailing
in 1837, the time when it was built. The Market
House is, in short, the quintessence of Penzance,
and that is the reason why I have included an
illustration of it. Be quite sure it is not for its
beauty, or for the justness of its proportions, nor
even for the white marble statue of Sir Humphry
Davy that has stood since 1872 in front of it, on
the site of the house in which he was born. He
is Penzance's greatest son, and was born here in
1778. Philosopher and chemist, and inventor of
the miner's safety-lamp, I dare to believe him a
greater and a more practical man than Sir Isaac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Newton. Davy died at Geneva in 1829, and
was buried there.</p>

<p>Davy at any rate was a man far more practical
than the wiseacres who built the Market House,
blocking up the middle of the street just where it
is at its busiest, and where traffic pours in from
confluent thoroughfares.</p>

<p>The ancient market-cross stood until recently
at its western end.</p>

<p>Penzance market-cross stood until 1829 in
the Green Market, but was in that year removed
to the corner of a house in North Street. When
that house was demolished, in or about 1868, the
cross was again moved on, finding a home, appropriately
enough, in the west wall of the Market
House. There it remained, its inscribed side
hidden against the wall, for some thirty years.
Loungers leaned lazy shoulders against it, butchers
rested sides of meat on it, and it grew, about the
head of it, a greasy object. And then some one,
in July 1899, hit upon the brilliant idea of removing
the cross and cleaning it, and placing it
upon a nice new base in the Morrab Gardens, with
a metal plate setting forth the year when these
things were done. And there it is dripped upon
by trees, and although granite is a hard and
obstinate substance, yet we have it upon unimpeachable
authority that "constant dropping
will wear away a stone," and certainly the cross
was better preserved by its greasy daily experiences
at the back of the Market House than
in its present dank situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>Although it is in shape and size (5 feet 6 inches
high), just a typical Cornish cross, it is one of the
most interesting: the front of it curiously incised
with little holes, while the back, hitherto hidden,
bears an inscription, which has been read as
"Hic procumbunt corpora Piorum."</p>

<div class="caption">PENZANCE MARKET HOUSE.</div>
</div>

<p>Beyond this hub of Penzance is the more
residential part, Alverton; and Alverton itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
is of two quite distinct periods. Firstly, the delightfully
quaint and cosy-looking Regency bay-fronted
and plaster-faced villas by the Morrab
Gardens, and then the modern stone-built residential
suburb about Morrab Road.</p>

<p>The sea-front is quite casual. It boasts a
hotel or two and some more early Regency cottages,
and the broad asphalted parade, raised by
a few feet above the narrow beach, commands
widespread views over the shallow waters of
Mount's Bay; but it is not thrust forward by
Penzance as a great feature. It just happened,
so to speak.</p>

<p>Almost coterminous with Penzance is Newlyn,
on the west. The name of Newlyn does not
indicate "new lake," or indeed, anything new,
but derives, like that of Newlyn near Newquay,
from St. Newlyna, or Neulwyn, a Breton maiden,
who was murdered by a suitor whose love she did
not requite. Pontivy Noyala, in Brittany, owes
the second half of its name to her.</p>

<p>Newlyn is, of course, a busy fisher-village, and
has now got a harbour of its own. They are
wilful people at Newlyn, or were, as the following
story will show.</p>

<p>Tithe of fish, as of other things, was claimed
of old by, and paid to, the clergy, but that is now
a thing of the past. The sturdy fisher-folk of
Newlyn were among the earliest to resist it.
They banded themselves together, painted "No
Tithe" on a board which they nailed to a wall,
to keep their determination hot, took especial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
care of their fish-offal, to the sorrow of the gulls,
and waited. It was not long before the lawyer
came to distrain for tithe. He got it, "in kind."
The contents&mdash;extremely unsavoury&mdash;of various
offal-tubs were poured over him.</p>

<p>About the year 1885 Newlyn began to be
genuinely astonished. Now your true Cornishman&mdash;and
they are all Cornishmen and true who
live at Newlyn&mdash;is not easily astonished; that
violent rippling of the mental surface is difficult
to accomplish here. So the thing that thus surprised
this fisher-town must have been, and was,
remarkable. It was nothing less than the discovery
of the artistic possibilities of the place.
Every one who knew Newlyn knew well enough
that it was picturesque: guide-books had told
them so, and those who could not discover it for
themselves, and knew only of the fishy smells
that pervaded the seashore and the crooked
alleys, would read to one another in those guide-books,
"The village is picturesque," and then
perceive that this was indeed the case. But although
J. C. Hook had for many years painted
Cornish seas, no one had yet painted the life of
this place, or of St. Ives, or that of any other
among the many characteristic villages of these
coasts. Cornish landscapes and seascapes, yes;
but the everyday existence of the folk who peopled
them had not been revealed to art as a thing
well worthy of treatment, alike for its drawing
and colour, and for its mingled pathos, nobility,
and the virtue of long endurance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>The Newlyners, be sure of that, did not suspect
themselves out of the common. Visitors to
Penzance discovered Newlyn as a curious place
worth a morning or an afternoon's exploration,
but not a place where the polite might stay.
That is to say, here is no up-to-date hotel, and
the folk are, or were, primitive. Their natural
politeness cannot be in question.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Stanhope Forbes, who has since
attained to the dignity of "R.A.," found Newlyn
and perceived its artistic value. He and Frank
Bramley were the founders of what has become
famous as the "Newlyn School." They painted
fish sales, domestic auctions, village weddings,
Christmas-Eve in Penzance, "Hopeless Dawn"
in a fisherman's cottage when the fishing-fleet has
been storm-tossed, and many another episode
in the life of the people, and quite early their
success brought about the large artist colonies
that have since settled, not only here, but at
St. Ives, and Polperro, and many another old-world
waterside village in Cornwall, their
practice that of the pioneers of Newlyn; for
although there are different "schools" of fish,
pilchards, mackerel, and other, in Cornish seas,
there is only one "school" artistic. Now it is
a strange thing that although the Newlyn School
is essentially English (or perhaps we should say
Cornish) in its subjects, its methods are distinctly
French in their origin.</p>

<p>It is nothing that the Newlyn School is that of
open-air painting, for the Pre-Raphaelites began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
to discredit the mere studio-painter so far back as
1848; but the peculiarly broad, frank technique,
honestly, and perhaps also ostentatiously, displaying
the brush work by which its results are
obtained, is a distinct importation from the French
schools. It has certainly taken root and thrived
well here. This purely technical innovation, owing
something, but not much, to the impressionists,
was applied to subjects that had rarely ever been
selected before, and with equal frankness, just
as they presented themselves; so that it became
with some critics a reproach to the Newlyners
that they had no selective qualities, and no power
of composition, and merely rendered what they
saw, as crudely as a photograph. To which these
new men might have replied that a striving after
mere prettiness was not their object, but that they
did indeed endeavour to render those things they
saw around them, just as they were.</p>

<p>That everyday working clothes and sea kit
were worth painting was a surprise to the men of
Newlyn, and the especial beauty of a weathered
and well-worn dress was not easily revealed to the
Newlyn women and girls. Many an artist, here
and elsewhere, has been sadly put about by the
fishermen who, having vanished for a while to
"clean themselves and get a bit tidy-like" have
come back in some go-to-meeting or other impossible
garb; while legends that painters personally
disliked cleanliness and order arose from
the despair of some at the seeming impossibility
of explaining that, artistically speaking, Sunday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
frocks, tidy hair, and clean pinners were not
improvements upon the usual week-day dishevellment,
and that to be bare-legged was sometimes
better than to be wearing nice new boots.
But to-day every one in Newlyn knows much
better than that; all have got some idea of artistic
terms and slang, and scarce a man among the
blue-jerseyed lot who lean against the railings
on the cliff-top between going out to the fishing-grounds
and digging the potato-patch but has
sat as a model or has watched the progress of a
canvas.</p>

<p>In these latter days there is added to the
traditional Newlyn industries a newer occupation,
which also bids to become in course of time
traditional. It is that of posing for artists. Be
sure that if you loiter here with anything
suspiciously like a sketch-book, and wear something
of an artistic appearance, you will be hailed
by expectant models.</p>

<p>"Would ye like me to sit for 'ee?"</p>

<p>"You're too tidy, I'm afraid," you perhaps say
at a venture; but there is no use in that, for it
is immediately met with: "All right, sir; I knows
what 'ee want. I'll just goo inside an' put on me
old hat an' coat."</p>

<p>He does so, and produces articles battered
and covered with the dust and mellow tints of
age, and hung, like bottles of old port, with
cobwebs.</p>

<p>That part of Mount's Bay in which Newlyn
is situated is known as Gwavas Lake. Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
years ago, the enterprise and daring of the Cornish
miners, who had located a vein of tin, caused the
opening of a novel kind of mine at the distance
of a quarter of a mile from the shore. The
Werra Mine shaft was sunk in an iron caisson to
a depth of a hundred feet, and tin to the value
of £3,000 was dug out before the courage of the
adventurers gave way and the speculation was
abandoned.</p>

<p>High on the hillside above and beyond Newlyn
stands Paul, less a village than a church presiding
over a few farms: all very Irish-looking.</p>

<p>I do not think many people would spend
much time in considering Paul as the site for
a desirable residence. It stands in too lofty
and exposed a situation for that: on an upland
bracing enough in summer, but in winter a very
playground of the winds. Few trees grow on
those heights, and thus the tall tower of Paul
church is not in the least hindered in its function
of standing there as a landmark. From most
points of view you perceive it, rising gauntly
against the sky-line, in apparent solitude: the
bulky tower of a church that must always have
been larger than needful for its surroundings.</p>

<img src="images/i_266.jpg" width="240" height="556" alt="" />
<div class="caption">MONUMENT TO SIR WILLIAM
GODOLPHIN, WITH ARMOUR.</div>
</div>

<p>No one ever thinks of adding "Saint" to
the name of Paul, although the place derives its
name from a saint: not the apostle Paul, to whom
the church was long ago re-dedicated, but to
St. Pol de Leon, a distinguished sixth-century
Welsh missionary, who settled at that place in
Brittany. The church contains a monument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
to Sir William Godolphin, dated 1681, and hung
with his helmet, breastplate, sword, and rapier;
but Paul is famed for a much more humble person:
the well-known Dolly Pentreath, who, according to
the monument erected here to her in 1860, by
Prince Louis Lucien Bonaparte, was the last
person who spoke the Cornish
language. The interest
of this scion of the Bonapartes
in Dolly Pentreath
was that of a student of
languages. Other Bonapartes
might dream of
glory and Empire; he was
a philologist, and took a
great deal more interest in
the memory of this old
fish-wife, who died in 1778
and spoke a dying tongue,
than in marshals and
generals. According to
surviving tales of the old
woman, she was a very
unamiable, cross-grained old
person; and it has been
left to later investigators to
throw doubt upon this
accidental fame. No one, of course, speaks Cornish
now, but phrases and odd words of that
extinct tongue are still current. I have heard&mdash;it
was twenty years ago, at Mousehole&mdash;a
mother calling her child indoors at dusk, "or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
else the bukkha-dhu will have you"; and
"bukkha-dhu," which means "black spirit," is
both Cornish and superstition.</p>

<p>A specimen of Cornish on the monument to
Dolly Pentreath renders the ordinary person
quite reconciled to its being an extinct language.
Here it is: the twentieth chapter of Exodus,
twelfth verse:</p>

<p>"Gwra perthi de taz ha de mam: mal de
dythiow bethenz hyr war an tyr neb an Arleth de
Dew ryes Dees."</p>

<p>That is to say:</p>

<p>"Honour thy father and thy mother: that
thy days may be long upon the land which the
Lord thy God giveth thee."</p>

<p>No one knows how Mousehole, the fisher-village
beyond Newlyn, got its name. It lies, it
is true, in a hole, but so also do most of these
villages; and there is also a cavern along the
shore, beyond the little harbour, but it is not
supposed that it originated the name. Mousehole
is a smelly place, but its smells are neither so
many nor so penetrating as they used to be. It
is remarkable for the sturdy old granite manor-house
of the Keigwin family in its very midst,
with very boldly projecting porch. For many
years past it has been the "Keigwin Arms" inn.
Some history attaches to it, for it was here, in
front of his own house, that Jenkin Keigwin was
killed in 1595, struck down by a cannon-ball
fired by the Spaniards in their raid of that year
upon Penzance, Newlyn, and Mousehole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>St. Clement's Island, just off Mousehole, had
once a chapel on its inhospitable rocks.</p>

<p>The cliff-paths from Mousehole for Lamorna
Cove trend inland through the farm-place of
Kemyll Wartha, and then descend steeply to the
landward end of the deeply indented little bay,
where the sea comes surging in amid great granite
boulders, to the grassy and rushy fringe of a brook
hurrying down from a valley dense with trees and
undergrowth. Commercial activities, in the way
of granite quarrying, are evident on the cliffs at
Lamorna.</p>

<p>On the way inland from Lamorna Cove to
Boleit, lying a little on the right hand in the
picturesque valley, stands the deserted old manor-house
of Trewoofe, once the seat of the Levelis
family, extinct in 1671. The ruined rooms and the
curiously and richly decorated doorway date from
about a hundred and thirty years earlier, when
it is quite evident that the Levelis family were
alike prosperous and filled with the conviction
that they would continue in the land for many
more generations. They traced their descent
from Norman times, and their doings are still the
theme of many legends in Penwith. But nothing
became that long-descended family more than
the charming epitaph on the last of their race,
written by some unknown hand, still to be read
in the neighbouring great church of St. Buryan:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Here lyes the Body of Arthur Leuelis, of Trewoof, in
this Parish, Esq., who departed this life the 2<sup>th</sup> day of May,
Anno Dom. 1671.</p></blockquote>

<p>Half a mile from Trewoofe, crossing the
Lamorna Brook and proceeding along the Trereen
road, is the very small hamlet of Boleit, the
"place of slaughter"; traditionally the place
where Athelstan finally overthrew the Cornish,
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 936, in a great battle. Certainly the mounds
and the standing-stones here and in the immediate
vicinity make it quite evident that some great
event has happened here. The nearest rude
stone pillar bears the name "Goon Rith," which
means the "Red Downs," and is really the
name belonging to the surrounding hill-sides. A
"fogou," or underground passage, a hiding-hole
for prehistoric people, exists near at hand, in a
very wilderness of undergrowth and brambles,
and still justifies the forgotten builders of it by
being extremely difficult to find. It is about
thirty-five feet long, with another passage leading
at right angles out of it. This retreat is formed
of granite slabs inclining inward, and roofed by
other slabs, covered with turf.</p>

<p>Two tall granite pillars stand to the right of
the road at Boleit. They are known as "the
Pipers," and are connected in legend with the
prehistoric stone circle three hundred feet distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
at Rosemoddress, known as the "Merry Maidens,"
or formerly the "Dawnz Maen," the "dancing
stones." Another circle of "Merry Maidens"
stands at Boscawen-Ûn, two miles distant, on the
other side of St. Buryan. The legend attached to
them says they were a party of girls turned to
stone as a punishment for dancing on Sunday,
together with the two pipers who played to them.</p>

<p>I well remember, a good many years ago,
seeking this circle of nineteen stones, at the conclusion
of a day spent at Land's End, and on the
return to Penzance. I floundered into a boggy
bottom at eventide, on the way to it, and emerged
from the sloughs only by the directions of a
farmer who happened to be working in his fields
not far away. It was an eerie place to stumble
into at the sunset hour, and it was a still more
eerie experience amid these stones to meet a
woman who might have been, from appearance
and manner, one of the weird sisters in <cite>Macbeth</cite>.
She mumbled incomprehensible things, and stared
wildly, and seemed in every way a fitting inhabitant
of that place at that hour. I found
afterwards she was really a harmless madwoman
of that neighbourhood, who wandered aimlessly
about.</p>

<p>"Skeers some folk, she does," said a neighbouring
farmer, "starring at 'n like a conger,
and sayin' things nobody can't make out nohow."</p>

<p>The coast-path leads past Boscawen Point
and then trends slightly inland, and descends to
the charming little St. Loy's Cove, through some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
woods. In another mile the track opens out a
view of the wooded valley ending in Penberth
Cove, furnished with its stream as usual, and with
two or three primitive cottages of picturesque
build, occupied by fishermen. The shore at
Penberth is paved with great blocks of granite;
not naturally paved, but laid there at some period
by human hands, with considerable pains, and
for no apparent advantage.</p>

<p>The way round by the cliffs direct to the
headland of Trereen Dinas, where the famous
Logan Rock is situated, is scarcely to be ventured.
The best way is up the delightful valley of Penberth,
past the mill-house, and so round to the
left by the "Logan Rock Inn," in the hamlet of

AND THE TELEGRAPH STATION&mdash;ST. LEVAN&mdash;PORTH

<p>It is half a mile from the stony hamlet of Trereen
to the Logan Rock, which stands up against the
skyline towards the seaward extremity of that
magnificently rugged headland, Trereen Dinas.
The narrow neck of this peninsula is deeply scored
across with a ditch and heaped with a parallel
wall of stones and earth, the defensive works of
a long-forgotten people, but it is not so much to
see these vestiges of insecure prehistoric times,
nor even to view the fine scenery, that a continual
stream of visitors comes hither all the summer.
It is the Logan Rock that attracts them. This
rock, one of the many "logans" in Cornwall which
are so balanced or pivoted by the natural weathering
of ages that they "log," or oscillate slightly,
to a vigorous push, is the most famous of its kind,
both for its own self and for the circumstances of
its later history. It is an irregular cube of granite
weighing sixty tons, some say ninety, poised
upon a great mass of fantastic rocks, curiously
jointed, and overlooking the sea from a height of
about two hundred feet. Borlase, writing in his
"Antiquities of Cornwall," 1754, declared it to be
"morally impossible that any lever, or indeed
force, however employed in a mechanical way,
can remove it from its present situation." The
same view was held by the country people, and so
worked upon Lieutenant Goldsmith of H.M.S.
cutter <em>Nimble</em>, cruising off-shore on the look-out
for smugglers, that he determined to overthrow
the stone and thus prove himself a fellow clever
beyond all expectation. So, on April 8th, 1824
(it would have been more appropriately done on
the 1st), he landed with a boat's crew of nine
men, and with handspikes and much personal
exertion did succeed in performing that which
Borlase and the united voice of the countryside
had declared to be impossible. He overthrew the
Logan Rock, and had it not become lodged in a
cleft, it must have descended into the sea and been
lost for ever. He did, incidentally, a great deal
more. The wanton act of folly rightly aroused
Cornwall to furious indignation, and he went in
great personal danger for awhile. If such an ass
as he had been lynched it would have been a
salutary warning to others. The Admiralty could
not ignore the anger that had been aroused, and
speedily intimated to Lieutenant Goldsmith that
he must either replace the rock or lose his commission.
The tackle for the purpose was lent to
him from the dockyard at Devonport, and after
much preparation and the construction of elaborate
staging, the rock was returned to its place on
November 2nd, in the presence of a vast crowd
assembled to witness it. The work was costly
beyond the means of a lieutenant, and was carried
through by subscription. Goldsmith's career was
ruined by this act of folly, and he died in 1841,
without promotion. The "logging" of the rock
was quite destroyed and, although it appears still
to be delicately poised, it requires great exertion
to induce even the suspicion of a tremor.</p>

<p>There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span> is an excellent good climb for the young
and active and the reckless down from this grim
granite promontory of Trereen Dinas to an
exquisitely secluded sandy cove, and thence up
again, and over more tumbled hummocks of the
all-pervading granite, to the sandy and shelly
shore of Porthcurno, properly Porth Kernow, the
"Port of Cornwall."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>But halt awhile! secluded, did I say that
sandy cove to be? So it may seem at certain
hours of the day, when the young barbarians of
the Eastern Telegraph Company are in office, at
work; but even then, when this yellow strand
under Trereen Dinas is indeed solitary, the
observant explorer, who thinks himself one of the
very few who ever scale these rocks and pace these
selvedges of the sea, will be startled, even as was
Robinson Crusoe on a memorable occasion, by the
imprint of a human foot. <em>A</em> human foot? Nay,
dozens of them, for this is, in short, one of the
favourite bathing-coves of the ninety or so telegraphist
probationers of the Eastern Telegraph
Company at Porthcurno. For at Porthcurno the
cable lands from Gibraltar and all the wide world,
including the Cocos Islands and places of unpronounceable
name in tropic climes, where white
men sweat and fume far from their kind and
dwell lovingly on the good time coming, when they
shall be home and in London again, living instead
of existing.</p>

<p>At Banjoewangi (which is a real place on the
Telegraph Company's system, somewhere back
even of Back of Beyond, and not what it looks like,
a nigger-minstrels' kingdom-come), London, you
know, seems a very desirable place.</p>

<p>Well, here is the E. T. C. telegraph station,
up inland a quarter of a mile from the cove; a
square white building with a flat, bomb-proof
roof, and here in various quarters are the officials,
and here too are some ninety probationers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
sixteen to eighteen years of age, or thereabouts,
all learning telegraphese, the punching of dots
and dashes on endless tapelike strips of paper
and the reading of the same: a sufficiently beastly
business, so what wonder if these ninety in their
off-hours be somewhat untamable!</p>

<p>All these things are late developments. A
few years ago Porthcurno was a wild little place,
and quite behind the age. Now it is perhaps even
a little in advance of it. An almost typically
suburban street runs up inland, and on the
elegantly thin iron telegraph-poles that carry
the land-lines of the E. T. C. are incandescent
electric globes with white shades, which light
the road at night. And on the cliffs the Telegraph
Company is trying a wireless installation of its own,
of which the visible evidence is a very tall and very
groggy-looking pole, stayed and tied elaborately.
Such is Porthcurno, the "PK" of telegraphists.</p>

<p>From Porthcurno, to reach the church of St.
Levan, you take the church path, avoiding the
hideous houses on the headland, plastered and of
a dismal neutral tint, that have recently been
built there. Through three fields runs the church-path,
and then the sea, with distant horizon,
opens out between the flanks of a combe, the four
pinnacles of St. Levan church-tower suddenly
rising before you, scarce above your line of vision.
The church, in fact, is built in a hollow&mdash;once a
solitary hollow&mdash;giving upon the sea, a place
where few strangers ever came in those distant
fifth-century days when St. Levan lived the hermit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
life. We know very little of that saint, except
the tale of the disastrous entertainment he offered
his sister when she came to visit him here. It
seems that he subsisted entirely upon the fish he
caught, and thinking he would spread a dainty
meal before his visitors, he went out and caught a
chad. The fish that came to his line he did not
consider good enough, so he threw it back. Not
before the identical fish had been caught three
times did he accept the inevitable, and he cooked
it accordingly; but at the first bite the child was
choked. St. Levan was illogical enough&mdash;and I
think blasphemous enough&mdash;to consider this a
judgment of Providence upon himself for refusing
what had been sent him. The chad was long
called locally "chack-cheeld." "St. Levan's
Path" to the rocks where he used to fish is still
pointed out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>The place teems with legends. Thus, the
great granite rock in the churchyard, called "St.
Levan's Stone," with a grass-grown gap in it, is
the subject of a local rhyme, which tells us that
when this slowly widening fissure has grown large
enough for the passage of a packhorse, the Day of
Judgment will be at hand. Personal observation
and judicious enquiries justify me in assuring
trembling sinners that, if this be indeed a guide,
that day is yet far off.</p>

<p>I have said St. Levan was solitary. The
immediate neighbourhood of the church is even
now not very densely populated, for the visible
buildings are only the rectory and a cottage; and
it can, I conceive, scarcely be called cheerful; for
the bell-buoy on that submerged rock, the Rundlestone,
out to sea, is for ever heard tolling, sometimes
like a funeral knell and at others like some
harsh gong, calling lost mariners to dinner down
there in weedy caves with the mermaids.</p>

<p>The little church of St. Levan is rich in old
bench-ends, displaying his fishes, a palmer with
cockle-shells in his hat, knights, ladies, and jesters;
while the chancel-screen is enriched with the
eagle of St. John, the lily of the Virgin, the sacred
monogram, and the spear, nails, and hammer of
the Crucifixion. The Virgin herself is rendered,
with round silly face and coif and fifteenth-century
ruff. There has been a great deal of restoration
effected here of late years.</p>

<p>A sundial in the churchyard displays a solemn
motto: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sicut umbra transeunt dies</i>, and a memorial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
to one of the Telegraph Company's probationers,
drowned while bathing at Porthcurno,
stands near by the grave of Captain Henry
Rothery and the twenty-two others lost in the
wreck of the <em>Khyber</em> at Porthloe in the storm
of March 15th, 1905.</p>

<p>The narrow cliff-path from St. Levan presently
leads to the small and rocky fishing-cove of Porth
Gwarra, the foreshore roughly paved with granite
blocks in between the projecting rocks, which
are here hollowed into caverns, where the few
boats and lobster-pots are stored. A yellow snapdragon
grows profusely in the cliffs here, and
ivy richly mantles some of the crags along the
coast towards Land's End; while a curious plant
with fleshy leaves, curved like giant talons,
and red and yellow flowers, called the "ice-plant,"
thickly drapes many of the rough walls
enclosing fields.</p>

<p>The cliffs here rise to their grandest in the
magnificent piles of granite blocks towering up
at the crested promontory of Tol-Pedn-Penwith,
the "Holed Headland in Penwith." The cliff-top
walk has here broadened out to an expanse
of short moss-like grass interspersed with rabbit-burrows,
knobs of lichened rock and tufts of
thrift or sea-pink. It is good going for the
pedestrian, but the grass is apt to be slippery.
A stranger wandering here alone suddenly finds
the chasm that gives Tol Pedn its name, directly
in his path.</p>

<p>There are few places on the coasts of Cornwall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
really dangerous, unless you go out of your way
to court danger, but this abrupt hole in the cliff-top
is really a deadly place. That no one appears
ever to have fallen down it and broken his neck
seems to be because strangers who walk these
cliffs generally do so with a very proper sense of
the perils which lie in the way of those who do
not exercise due caution. Any one who walked
here in one of the frequent sea-fogs would stand
an excellent chance of walking right over the edge
of this hole in the headland, and so falling an
inevitable one hundred feet to his death. This
great circular gap, the "Funnel," as some call it,
is about thirty feet across, and is a real startler.
It was formed just in the same manner as the
"Lion's Den," near the Lizard, and the "Devil's
Frying Pan," near Cadgwith, by the falling-in of
the roof of a cave; and the beach down below
communicates with the sea. Adjoining it, from
the cliffs' edge, rises the impressive pile of granite
rock called "Chair Ladder," tinted all hues by
weathering and by lichens, from black and grey
to green, red, and a vivid orange. It is not
difficult to climb down into the black depths
below Chair Ladder, or to the beach, but it
requires rather more energy to return. To style
Chair Ladder and the other rocky spires neighbouring
it piles of rock is by no means straining
language, for they have exactly the appearance
of having been heaped one upon another by some
superhuman energy, the granite cubes being
jointed like so many blocks of rude cyclopean
masonry. The coast here indeed displays some
of the most curious imitative forms in natural
architecture, and every point and every little
porth has its old Cornish name.</p>

<div class="caption">"CHAIR LADDER."</div>
</div>

<p>The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span> point of Carn Guethensbras, the "Great
Carn," juts out beyond Chair Ladder, and encloses
Porthloe, the "Lake Port." It was here that the
homeward-bound sailing ship <em>Khyber</em>, from
Australia, was cast away in March 1905, and
twenty-three of the twenty-six aboard were
drowned. An Admiralty signalling station has
since been established on the cliffs.</p>

<p>I was walking here in August 1909, and two
men came hurrying out of the signal-station.</p>

<p>"Are you a doctor, sir," they asked.</p>

<p>I felt unreasonably ashamed that I was not.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Why, 'zno, a man, one of a party camping
tu Porth Gwarra, runnen along th' cliffs, has
fell'd down a hunner 'an twenty feet, an' scat's
head all to bits, an' we'm most at our wits' end
what to du."</p>

<p>It seemed, hearing a report like this, that there
was really nothing to do but hold an inquest;
but doctors had been telegraphed for to Penzance,
and when at last they arrived, the man was not
dead. It was a marvellous escape. Falling down
the jagged rocks, into a place difficult of access,
from which the coastguard only brought him up
on a stretcher after great exertion, he was not
killed outright; and indeed, according to later
advices, eventually recovered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>A lovely nook opens out beyond Pendower
Cove, at Nanjizel, or Mill Bay, where there is a
natural archway and a tall rifted cavern in the
headland of Carn-les-Boel, known as the "Song
of the Sea," perhaps the most entirely beautiful
and romantic cave in Cornwall.</p>

<p>Past this, the point of Carn Voel is reached,
with the "Lion's Den" cavern. Ahead, the
heights of Pardenick Point rise in columnar
majesty, the point whence Turner painted his
view of the Land's End, that extraordinarily
fantastic and darkling composition, in which the
rocks on the hillsides look more like sheep than
rocks.</p>

<p>There stretch the stacked rocks of <em>Bolerium</em>,
the Land's End, in Cornish "Pedn-an-Laaz," and
in Welsh, "Pen-Gwaed," the Headland of Blood;
in effect not remotely resembling bundles of cigars
set on end.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="smallfont">THE LAND'S END DISTRICT&mdash;ST. BURYAN&mdash;SENNEN&mdash;LAND'S
END&mdash;THE LONGSHIPS LIGHTHOUSE.</span></h2>

<p>Most strangers obtain their first sight of Land's
End at the conclusion of a direct walk or drive
from Penzance. It is generally the first place
the stranger desires to see, and he makes directly
for it along the high road that runs inland.</p>

<p>The Land's End district, stretching westward
from Penzance, forms the hundred of Penwith,
a Celtic word meaning the "great, or chief,
headland"; and Land's End itself was formerly
"Penwithstart," a curious word produced by the
association of the Celtic "Penwith," which had
in very early times come to mean the district in
general, with the purely Saxon "steort," or
"start," a word which indicates a projecting
point: an object that in fact juts, or starts, out.
Hence, for example, the name of the Start, that
prominent headland in South Devon, one of the
most salient promontories along our coasts.</p>

<p>The aspect of the country, as you proceed
from Penzance into the Land's End district, is
quite in keeping with the name. Everything
appears to resign itself to an ending. The town
of Penzance looks like a last great urban effort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
and the railway itself seems to come, tired out, to
the shores of Mount's Bay, and to expire, rather
than come to a terminus. It cannot make an
effort even to get up into the town, but stops
on the doorstep, so to say. And the large white
granite station, with iron and glass roof, more
resembles an aviary than a railway terminus,
the sparrows assembling there in multitudes on
the tie-rods, and chattering in almost deafening
fashion. In those very considerable intervals between
the coming and going of trains one may
stand on the platform and not be able to hold a
conversation, owing to the sparrows.</p>

<div class="caption">EARLY HOME OF LORD EXMOUTH.</div>
</div>

<p>The western suburb of Alverton, with its
beautiful gardens, and the birthplace, or early
home, of Edward Pellew, afterwards Viscount
Exmouth, left behind, and the elm-avenues of
Trereife and the stream at Buryas Bridge once
passed, on the main road to Buryan and Land's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
End, you come to an elevated tract of country
where trees are few. Cultivation gradually grows
the exception, instead of the rule, and there is
a look as though Nature herself had grown weary
and presently could do no more.</p>

<p>Three miles out from Penzance the road forks.
You may go equally well either to right or left.
Let us take the left-hand road, through the half-way
village of St. Buryan, which itself adds no
hospitable note to the scene, but seems to stand
on the windy upland as an example of how ashen-hued
and weatherbeaten a village may be. The
tall, dark church-tower rising from its midst and
serving as a landmark for miles, is the most
striking feature of the place. St. Buriana, the
patron saint, was originally Bruinech, daughter
of an Irish chieftain, who adopted the religious
life. The existing church, successor of a collegiate
establishment founded by Athelstan, the Saxon
conqueror of Cornwall, in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 936, stands on the
site of her oratory. It was last rebuilt in the
Late Perpendicular style prevailing so largely
in Cornwall, and is a fine large building. Two
ancient granite crosses on steps stand outside;
one in the churchyard, the other in the village
street.</p>

<p>From St. Buryan the road descends presently
to the valley of Penberth a wooded interlude,
and thence rises to other bare and bleak heights,
passing at one mile from Land's End the turning
that leads to Sennen, on the alternative road.</p>

<p>Sennen takes its name from Senan, one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
numerous Irish missionary saints. He returned
to Ireland, and died there. It was perhaps the
friendship he cultivated with the Welsh St.
David that led to Llansannan church in Denbighshire
being dedicated to him.</p>

<p>Sennen is the very negation of life. Conceive
a village that is no village, but only a small,
grey, solemn church, a plainly built inn with
creaking sign, swaying in the wind, a few whitewashed
granite cottages, and a gaunt granite
chapel. Through the place runs the road to the
Land's End, and all around are fields enclosed
within stone hedges. Never a tree in sight.
That is Sennen. If you be a painter, you will
not need to set your palette with many or brilliant
colours to represent it as it is. It does not seem
attractive; but in spite of all this gaunt, weatherbeaten
character Sennen is not unlovely. The
pearly, often opalescent, qualities of the Cornish
skies are capable of transcending even four-square
grey granite houses with slate roofs, and ugly
chapels of the like, and of glorifying even stone
hedges and unfertile fields; and so long as Sennen
remains true to itself and innocent of red brick
and ornament, which would be alien here, and
therefore vulgar, even its weatherbeaten self is
not without charm.</p>

<p>But if Sennen be indeed in the restricted key
of grey and white, there is plentiful colour on the
moorland around it, where the gorse spreads like
lavishly flung gold, mingled with abundant purple
heather. Not the scent of the sea, but the honey-like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
fragrance of those blossoms, pervades the
place. The sea, indeed, although only a mile
distant, whether at Land's End or at Sennen
Cove, is not in view, nor is there any hint of it.
Only the treeless land, the sudden gusts of wind
that come booming along in a clear sky, and the
sign of the inn give any idea of its neighbourhood.
The sign reads, as you go west, "The Last House
in England," and as you return it is "The First."
But effluxion of time and the insistence of enterprise
have qualified these legends, and there are
two others, at Land's End itself: "The Land's
End Hotel," and a little shanty where refreshments
are to be had.</p>

<p>And from the turning to Sennen one comes
thus along an unromantic final stretch of road to
Land's End.</p>

<p>The name, "Land's End," has an eloquent appeal
understood, or if not really and truly understood,
certainly felt, by all. When one first
heard of Land's End, it was in those early years,
when it indicated an actual ending, in which the
lesson presently to be learnt&mdash;that the earth is
round&mdash;had no part. The image then figured
in the mind was that of a place truly ultimate,
unqualified by the statement that it is so many
thousands of miles across the seas to America,
where the land commences again. To know
that it <em>does</em> commence again is perhaps disappointing:
just as a sequel to a story is an ill
thing alike for the dramatic ending of that story
and for the sequel itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>And now we all know that, as the world is
round, there cannot be any land's end, anywhere,
here or at Finisterre, or in any other country;
and that in the quest of it we should be like so
many futile Wandering Jews. One almost envies
those heretics&mdash;that small but constant band&mdash;who
persist in their faith that the earth is flat;
for that view surely connotes a Land's End,
somewhere. Meanwhile, we must put up with
the chastened feeling of romance with which a
journey to the Land's End of Cornwall is first
undertaken.</p>

<div class="caption">LAND'S END. [<em>After J. M. W. Turner.</em></div>
</div>

<p>I cannot, at any rate, find fault with the circumstances
of my own first journey to this spot,
from London, many years ago. It was before
photographic and other illustrations had multiplied
so vastly, a time before even the untravelled
were very well acquainted with the general appearance
of the most distant and obscure places;
and one could still cherish some feeling of curiosity.
In those days the Great Western Railway, while
issuing excursion tickets to Penzance and elsewhere,
did so as though it were a weakness, of
which it were well to say as little as possible. The
hoardings did not in those times flame with
pictures of places which were apparently created
for the benefit of enterprising railway companies.</p>

<p>I made that excursion journey alone from Paddington
to Penzance; and when the long day was
drawing to its close and the train, having left
Truro, and most of the other passengers, behind,
began to wind through the mining-fields of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
Chacewater and Scorrier, where the deserted
mines and their ruined chimney-stacks and 'count-houses
looked in the gathering twilight like so
many weird beasts of the world's youth, then, as
I gazed pale-faced, from a corner of the unlighted
carriage, I felt I was indeed coming to
the Land's End. Perhaps, also a little sorry for
having come. But that was the dramatic, and
therefore the right, way. Penzance formed a
cheerful interlude for the night, and then on the
morrow came the ten miles' walk to Land's End
itself.</p>

<p>One has plenty of company here. Brake-loads
of people, cyclists, motor-cars, all day long: contemplative
people, reverent people, disappointed
and irreverent people, a little contemptuous.
You can see the thought, "Is this all?" visibly
expressed upon their faces. I don't know what
they expected: perhaps something in the nature
of that childish vision of an abysmal ending,
with a horned and hoofed personal devil over
the edge; or, at the very least, whales spouting
and sharks swimming. And really the cliffs are
but some sixty feet high, and it is not a difficult
matter to scramble down to the shore, such a
tiny exigent bit of shore as there is, at low-water.</p>

<p>The very worst thing to do, to get an adequate
idea of Land's End, is to stand upon Land's End
itself. It is not impressive, and you want that
which you will hardly get here, except on a
winter's day or late in the evening: solitude. It
is, in fact, not so much the comparative tameness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
of the spot as the too much company that is really
at the bottom of the not very reasoned dissatisfaction
most people feel here; and the guides who
wish to point out "Dr. Johnson's Head," the
"Armed Knight," and other rock-resemblances,
are a nuisance. No: go rather a little to the
north of Land's End, and then look back upon it,
and thence you will see the little crowds of people
clustered about it, giving a much-needed idea of
scale; and the natural arch beneath it then is
visible, and Enys Dodnan and other rocky islets
come properly into perspective, with the Longships
lighthouse yonder; and, if it be sunset,
you may see the round red face of the sun setting
on the distant horizon, with some scattered black
specks in front. Those are the Isles of Scilly,
twenty-seven miles away. The sea in between
is "Lethosow," traditionally the site of that lost
land of Lyonesse which, with its one hundred and
forty churches, was suddenly overwhelmed by
the sea in a great storm, vaguely about a thousand
years ago. Carew indeed gravely tells us
that fishermen at the Seven Stones (a lonely reef
thirteen miles north of St. Mary's Island, marked
by a lightship) have drawn up with their nets
pieces of doors and windows! The Fishermen
even to this day call the spot "The City."</p>

<p>The Longships lighthouse is about a mile and
a half out at sea, but such is the deceptive purity
of the atmosphere that, to a Londoner, it looks less
than half that distance. Carn Brâs, the reef on
which it stands, rises forty-five feet above the sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
at low water, and all around it are numerous
rocks, marked on Ordnance maps "Kettles
Bottom." The original lighthouse, built in 1793,
was a very stumpy affair, and was rebuilt in 1872.
It has a singularly tragic record. Four of the
lighthouse men have at different times been
washed off the rock and drowned, the last in 1877;
another died in the lighthouse, one went raving
mad, and another committed suicide. He lacerated
himself severely and his two mates staunched
his wounds by stuffing them with tow. They
hoisted signals for assistance, but stormy weather
severed all communication for some days, and he
was at last landed only to die. It is a melancholy
history, and that and the weird noises made by
the sea in caverns under the reef make the Longships
one of the least desirable of berths at the
disposal of the Trinity House.</p>

<p>Here in November 1898 the steamship <em>Bluejacket</em>
ran at full speed upon the rocks.</p>

<p>The Wolf lighthouse, eight miles from shore,
is a picture of utter loneliness. It was built
between 1862 and 1869 on the reef of that name,
awash with the tide at high-water, and cost
£62,726.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="smallfont">THE SCILLY ISLANDS&mdash;FLOWER-FARMING&mdash;THE INHABITED
ISLANDS&mdash;ST. MARY'S&mdash;STAR CASTLE&mdash;SAMSON
AND "ARMOREL OF LYONESSE"&mdash;SIR
CLOUDESLEY SHOVEL&mdash;TRESCO&mdash;THE SEA-BIRDS.</span></h2>

<p>The Isles of Scilly lie twenty-seven miles off the
mainland and forty miles from Penzance, the
nearest harbour from which you can voyage to
that fortunate archipelago. It is possible in
these days to reach St. Mary's, the capital of
Scilly, in a little over sixteen hours from London,
doing it luxuriously, as far as the railway portion
of the journey is concerned, by taking the 9.50 p.m.
train from Paddington, which arrives at Penzance
terminus at 7.30 the next morning, leaving two and
a half hours' rest before the steamer <em>Lyonesse</em>
leaves for the islands, a voyage of about four
hours. But this is suspiciously like toiling to get
your pleasure, for night travel, however well-appointed,
is tiring, and then you miss the scenery
on the way. Upon this writer at least, the
delights of the country, as seen framed in the
carriage-windows of the flying express, never
pall, and he who forgoes the daylight journey by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
the Great Western Railway misses much. The
best method of reaching Scilly is therefore by
taking the 10.30 a.m. restaurant car train <em>ex</em>
Paddington, which delivers you upon Penzance
platform at 5.5 p.m.; a railway journey of 305-1/4
miles, performed at the rate of nearly fifty miles
an hour throughout.</p>

<p>The <em>Lyonesse</em> leaves Penzance at 10 a.m.
Over that voyage of forty miserable miles&mdash;miserable
or magnificent according to whether you are
what is called a "good sailor" or not&mdash;I would
like to draw a veil. Once the steamer has passed
the Rundlestone and left the lee of the land (with
some even before) the woes of the "bad sailor"
begin. Do I not know it, all too well? Alas!
yes. But the potent charm of Scilly may well
be deduced from the fact of such a voyager revisiting
the islands, knowing full well that even a
"good passage," which phrase in these rolling
leagues seems like the ill-timed saturnine humour
of a misanthrope&mdash;will prostrate him in the scuppers,
or fling him athwart the bulwarks, yearning
for peace and rest in the creaming billows that go
dizzily seething past. Here let me not fail to add,
for the comfort of those who would dare the deed,
that "once pays for all," as the old proverb says.
Your miseries, generally speaking, are confined
to the outward voyage, and, although you may
be thoughtful and perhaps apprehensive of the like
disturbance in returning, Neptune generally refrains
from exacting other tribute. You have paid your
footing, if staggering along the heaving deck (ugh!)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
may so be called; and having paid your fare in
money and in kind, are free of the ocean blue.</p>

<p>The Scillies rise slowly out of the waters as you
approach. There is St. Mary's Island ahead, with
St. Martin's on the extreme right, rising behind
the numerous rocky islets known as the Eastern
Islands, comprising Menewethan, Great and Little
Inishvouls, Great and Little Arthur, Ragged
Island, Hanjague, Nornor, Great and Little
Ganilly, and Great and Little Ganinick. There
are two means of approach to the pier at St.
Mary's, to which the steamer comes: if it be high
tide, by Crow Sound; if at ebb by the circuitous
route of St. Mary's Sound. It is the last despairing
misery of the sea-sick, who know nothing of the
local conditions of navigation, to notice that the
captain, apparently out of sheer wanton cruelty,
is making a prolonged circuit of the island before
coming to an anchor.</p>

<p>But these miseries are speedily forgotten when
once you have set foot upon the quay at Hugh
Town, St. Mary's; for you realise at once that you
have come to a new and strange, and interesting,
land.</p>

<p>The Isles of Scilly are the land of the narcissus
and the daffodil, but not of those alone. Arum
lilies, stocks, wallflowers, and crimson anemones
are grown abundantly. There are in all 3,600
acres in the islands, and of these 2,000 are cultivated,
chiefly nowadays in the flower-farming
interest. It was in 1878, or thereabouts, that the
first ideas of flower-farming took root in Scilly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
There had always been, time beyond the memory
of man, more or less wild narcissi growing on
the isles. It was thought, without any evidence
being available, that the old Benedictine monks
of Tresco had introduced them. There were
eight varieties known to botanists. Some time
subsequently to 1834, Mr. Augustus Smith, the
then Lord Proprietor of the islands, uncle of
the present Mr. Dorrien-Smith, introduced many
others to Tresco, and it is claimed for him that he
was the first to see the possibilities of a London
market for these delightful flowers, blossoming
here so early, when London is still shivering in
midwinter. According to this article of faith, he
advised some of his tenants to grow them and
send them up to Covent Garden for sale, himself
sending the first lot, and realising £1 profit from
the transaction. According to other versions, it
was Mr. Trevellick, of Rocky Hill, St. Mary's, who
made the first consignment; and there is a circumstantial
story which tells us that he and a few
pioneers, who despatched a few bunches in those
early years, when fresh spring blossoms first took
London with delight, realised thirty shillings a
dozen bunches. A bunch in Scilly is a dozen
blooms; and therefore those fortunate few took
twopence-halfpenny apiece for narcissi. It seems
almost too good to be true, and still the Scillonians
(there are no "Scilly people," as Sir Walter
Besant makes Armorel say, in his delightful
"Armorel of Lyonesse") talk in reverential tones
of those wonderful days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>At that time the islanders were making a
moderate livelihood out of growing early potatoes;
I have seen the quays of St. Mary's heaped high
with boxes of them. But nowadays let those
grow "new potatoes" who will. Scilly knows
a more excellent way, and specialises in flowers so
completely, that no one would be in the least
surprised to hear of potatoes being imported, just
as Scilly imports its cabbages and other vegetables,
its butter, and most other things, from "England."</p>

<p>The growth of flower-farming in Scilly has
been continuous, and is by no means restricted
to St. Mary's: the "out-islands" take an active
part. But it is not the easy business it was, for
the increased output has naturally by degrees
brought prices down, and a steady shilling a dozen
bunches would now be considered good. The
business increases so surely that this year's
figures are out of date the next season. It was
considered remarkable in 1893, when the shipments
amounted to something over four hundred tons,
but those of 1910 exceeded one thousand tons,
valued at £40,000. Of this total, the sum of
£25,000 is reckoned to be clear profit. So, although
the flower-farmers have now to work for
their increase, the results are not discouraging,
and the Scillies still remain, and increasingly
become, the Fortunate Isles. The climate is
mild and equable, there are no poor; "penal"
Budgets raise no alarms, for the isles are free from
income-tax; and the wan, ragged, famished
spectre of unemployment, or of the unemployable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
is unknown. Scillonians read of it in the newspapers
that occasionally come their way, and ask
visitors what it is!</p>

<p>Every one works in Scilly. I have seen it
stated that Scillonians never hurry. The person
who made that statement can never have witnessed
the desperate efforts often made to pack
the flowers, and get them on to the quay at St.
Mary's in time for the steamer, which, in winter,
when the flower-harvest is at its height, sails only
thrice a week. If the steamer is missed, that
consignment is worth just nothing at all, for it
has to be on sale in London the next morning.</p>

<p>Visitors to Scilly, who commonly travel in
summer and autumn, see nothing of these activities.
Then, if ever, the islanders who are flower-farmers
take things easily, and the little fields where the
daffodils and the narcissi grow are of comparatively
small interest, being bare of leaves or
blossoms.</p>

<p>The fields are all carefully hedged round with
shrubs calculated to ward off the winds, which are
the farmer's greatest enemy. They are hedges
of tamarisk, of laurel, and of escallonia; but
chiefly of escallonia, a small-leaved evergreen
shrub with a close-growing habit. Strangers at
the first sight of its small delicate pink, waxlike
blossoms are taken with delight, but it is to the
islanders a mere commonplace. Some fields are
large, but most very small, giving less chance for
the winds to come and play havoc, and the hedges
grow to great heights. Picking the blossoms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
begins as early as Christmas and generally ends in
March, when the season "in England" begins, and
Scilly rests from its labours, happy in the knowledge
that it has skimmed the cream of the trade.</p>

<p>Photographs of fields rich in daffodil and
narcissus blossom are familiar, but not readily
to be understood, unless on the assumption that
they represent a glut in the market, rendering it
not worth while to pick them; for the practice is
so to arrange the crop that there is a succession of
blossoms in the two months and a half, and
always to pick them before they are actually
opened in full. They are then taken to long
glass sheds, and having been tied in bunches of a
dozen, are placed in water. Packing then follows.
In the height of the season the school-children
have a month's holiday from school, especially
to help in the work of picking and packing. There
are about four dozen bunches to a box, and 240
boxes to a ton. Often the packing is continued
all night and into the early hours of the morning.
Steam-launches bring laden boats in from the out-islands
by nine o'clock in the morning, and an
hour later there are perhaps fifty tons of flowers
aboard the steamer.</p>

<p>Such are now the chief activities of the Scilly
Isles, and they, with fishing and piloting, make up
the entire life of the archipelago. Formerly it
was new potatoes, and before that a little kelp-burning,
and before that a good deal of smuggling
kept the islanders alive.</p>

<p>Whence the isles derive their name no man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
knows. They are first mentioned by Ausonius,
who styles them <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sillinæ Insulæ</i>. Some declare
them to be named from a branch of the ancient
Silures; others consider "silya," a name for the
conger, to be the origin; and yet others think
"sulleh," the sun-rocks, to be the true derivation.
There are now five inhabited islands. The largest
of these, St. Mary's, contains 1,620 acres and a
population of 1,200; Tresco has 700 acres; St.
Martin's, 550 acres, St. Agnes, 350 acres, and
Bryher, 300 acres. Samson, last inhabited in
1855, has 80 acres. The smaller and uninhabited
islets are Annet, 40 acres, St. Helens, 40 acres:
Teän and Great Ganniley, each 35 acres, Arthur,
30 acres, Great and Little Ganniornic, 10 acres,
Northwithiel and Gweal, each 8 acres, and Little
Ganniley, 5 acres. Besides these, there are some
hundreds of rocky islets and rocks.</p>

<p>The Isles of Scilly have never been too remote
for conquerors to descend upon and subdue them.
Thus Athelstan not only subjugated Cornwall in
the tenth century, but subdued Scilly as well;
and they were fortified in the time of Queen
Elizabeth, when the still-existing Star Castle,
overlooking St. Mary's, was built, as the initials,
E. R. and the date 1593, remain to prove. Scilly
was not a safe place of refuge for Prince Charles
in 1645. He landed at St. Mary's from Falmouth
on March 4th, but the fleets of the Parliament
rendered it advisable for him to depart for
Guernsey on April 17th. But the isles became,
only four years later, the headquarters of a determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
band of Royalists under Sir John Grenville,
whose privateering exploits so dealt with the
shipping trade that it was found necessary to fit
out an expedition against him. He was reduced
and forced to capitulate in June 1651.</p>

<p>From early times the greater part of the
Islands belonged to Tavistock Abbey. In 1539,
when the Abbey was suppressed, they reverted to
the Crown. From the time of Queen Elizabeth,
the Godolphin family and Dukes of Leeds held
them on lease, and so continued, except during
the Commonwealth period, until 1831. A lease
from the Duchy of Cornwall was then taken up by
Augustus Smith, a landowner from Hertfordshire,
who thus became the first of the Smith and Smith-Dorrien
"Lords Proprietors," whose rule, from
their residence on Tresco, has been absolute.</p>

<p>Augustus Smith was an autocrat, but a benevolent
one. He found the islanders a half-starved
race of smugglers and kelp-burners, and by the
time of his death, in 1872, left them a prosperous
community.</p>

<p>St. Mary's Island is of irregular shape, and is
nine miles in circumference. The one town of
Scilly, "Hugh Town," stands on the low sandy
isthmus of a rocky, almost islanded, peninsula,
nearly awash at very high tides, and with two
sea-fronts. Over it towers the hill called "The
Garrison," crested by Star Castle, so called from
its ground-plan of a seven-pointed star; or,
some say from "Stella Maris," Star of the Sea;
a somewhat unlikely Roman Catholic dedication,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
considering the Protestant times in which it was
built. There has been no garrison here since 1863.
A tall wind-gauge stands near by, on the hill-top.</p>

<div class="caption">STAR CASTLE, AND THE ISLAND OF SAMSON.</div>
</div>

<p>From hence one best sees the island of Samson,
two miles and a half distant, lying directly in
front of the setting sun. Samson is an island of
singular appearance, consisting of two hills joined
by a low belt of land. Its name probably derives
from that sainted sixth-century Bishop of Dôl,
who has given his name to St. Sampson's (or
Samson), Golant. There are some ruined houses
on Samson, sole relics of the fifty people who once
lived on it, and were deported to other islands by
the autocratic Augustus Smith. And on Samson's
northern hill are no fewer than eleven large
sepulchral barrows. But if one wants to learn
much about Samson and about the Isles of Scilly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
glorified by romance, it is to the pleasant pages of
Sir Walter Besant's novel, "Armorel of Lyonesse,"
one must go. There is no better book to read
at Scilly. But Armorel's wonderful old home at
Holy Hill is not in being, although photographs
show the ruined walls of a house more or less
identified with it. Besant no doubt took as his
model the flower-farm at Holy Vale, in the centre
of St. Mary's Island.</p>

<div class="caption"><em>Gibson &amp; Sons, Penzance.</em>] ARMOREL'S HOME, SAMSON ISLAND.</div>
</div>

<p>Standing on the Garrison at night, the lights
of many lighthouses and lightships are visible.
There, on the almost exactly hemispherical outline
of Round Island, is the lighthouse that shows
a red flash; the Seven Stones lightship is out far
beyond; St. Agnes light flashes on its island,
south-east; and behind it, four and a half miles
away, is the lonely Bishop lighthouse, completed
in 1858, and said by some to be exposed to worse
weather and more terrific seas than any lighthouse
in the world. The lighthouse on St. Agnes is one of
the oldest, if not actually the oldest, in the service.
It was built in 1680.</p>

<p>The wrecks upon Scilly have been innumerable,
and the crowded churchyard overlooking Old
Town Bay bears witness to the great loss of life
incurred, even in modern times. Here rest one
hundred and twenty of the three hundred lost in
the wreck of the German mail steamship <em>Schiller</em>,
which was on her way from New York to Plymouth.
She struck on the Retarrier reef, close by the
Bishop lighthouse, in a fog on the night of
May 8th, 1875, and almost immediately sank.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Only forty-five of the three hundred and fifty-four
persons on board were saved.</p>

<p>The Scilly Islands are not less remarkable
for rock-scenery than the mainland, and weirdly
imitative piles of granite abound. There is a
rock, or rather a heap of rocks, on Peninis Head,
called the "Pulpit Rock," which at evening looks
less like a pulpit than a naval gun; and elsewhere
are the "Punch Bowl," on St. Mary's, the "Nag's
Head," on St. Agnes, and many others. Not
least among these is the Logan Rock, on Peninis
Head, which weighs over three hundred tons, and
"logs" in a most satisfactory manner, when once
started. But it is a brace-breaking business, this
starting of it, and you had better have a guide,
for this particular rock is not easily to be distinguished
from its fellows; and it is exhausting
to attempt the moving of other, and immovable,
rocks of three or four hundred tons, before you
happen to hit upon the right one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>Round past Old Town is the rocky head of
Giant's Castle, and then Porthellick.</p>

<img src="images/i_312.jpg" width="600" height="325" alt="" />
<div class="caption">PULPIT ROCK.</div>
</div>

<p>Porthellick, the "Bay of Willows," is a flat,
shallow strand, where the scant herbage at the
foot of Sallakey Down dies gradually away upon
the beach. At one extremity of the Bay is the
curious pile of granite rocks resembling a loaded
camel, kneeling, and at the other a rude fragment
of granite has been set upon another, on the sand,
to form a rough and ready monument, marking
the spot where the body of Admiral Sir Cloudesley
Shovel was buried.</p>

<p>The story of the naval disaster in which the
Admiral and nearly eighteen hundred men were
lost is one of the most tragic associated with
Scilly. A squadron consisting of the flagship
<em>Association</em>, the <em>Eagle</em>, <em>Phoenix</em>, <em>Lenox</em>, <em>Royal
Anne</em>, <em>St. George</em>, <em>Romney</em>, and <em>Firebrand</em>, returning
from an expedition against Toulon, in October
1707, lost its course in foggy weather. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
the 22nd the <em>Association</em> struck on the Bishop and
Clerks rocks and immediately went down, with
all on board; the <em>Eagle</em> and <em>Romney</em> were also
lost, together with the <em>Firebrand</em>, but a few on
board the last were saved. The other vessels
miraculously escaped. A great deal of mystery
was made respecting the disaster and the fate of
the Admiral, and a legend, long implicitly believed,
gained currency that the shipwrecks were entirely
due to the savage obstinacy of the Admiral, who,
it was stated, not only refused to listen to a
sailor, a native of Scilly, on board, who warned
him that he was steering too far northward, but
actually had the man hanged from the yardarm
for presuming to know better than his superiors.
That such a story should ever have gained belief
in itself shows us how undesirable service in the
Royal Navy must then have been. The sailor,
the story goes on to say, asked one favour before
he was turned off&mdash;that he should be allowed to
read a portion out of the Bible. It was granted,
and he read the 109th Psalm, one of the cursing
Psalms, with this salient passage: "Let his days
be few; and let another take his office. Let his
children be fatherless and his wife a widow....
Let his posterity be destroyed, and in the next
generation let his name be clean put out. Because
his mind was not to do good, but persecuted
the poor, helpless man, that he might slay him
that was vexed at the heart."</p>

<p>The whole story is a fabrication, simply
elaborated out of the narrative told by George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
Lawrence, quartermaster of the <em>Romney</em>, to Edmund
Herbert, Deputy Paymaster-General of
Marines, and detailed in his report of 1709.
Lawrence was the one man saved from the <em>Romney</em>,
and he said that about one or two o'clock on the
afternoon of October 22nd, the Admiral called
a council of officers, to discover in what latitude
they were. All agreed they were off Ushant,
except the master of the <em>Lenox</em>, who said they
were off Scilly. Then a lad also declared a light
they presently made was Scilly light, whereupon
all the ship's crew swore at him.</p>

<p>Among the many contradictory stories told
of the finding of Sir Cloudesley Shovel's body on
the sands of Porthellick, the most tragic version
is probably the most truthful. It was at first
given out that he was dead when found, and he
certainly was buried here, where the rude stone
monument now stands&mdash;a spot where, superstition
says, grass will never grow. Four days
later, the body was dug up, identified, and eventually
given a State funeral in Westminster
Abbey.</p>

<p>No one could tell what had become of a very
valuable emerald ring the Admiral wore, and his
widow offered rewards for it, in vain. But many
years later, about 1734, a woman of St. Mary's,
then lying at the point of death, made the terrible
confession that the Admiral had been washed
ashore, exhausted, but still living, and that she
had choked him, to secure his clothes and
jewellery. She produced the ring, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
sent to Lord Dursley, afterwards Earl of Berkeley.
It has been set with diamonds in a locket, and in
that form is still possessed by the Berkeley family.</p>

<img src="images/i_315.jpg" width="600" height="412" alt="" />
<div class="caption">HOLY VALE.</div>
</div>

<p>Holy Vale, inland, is one of the few places on
St. Mary's where trees grow. Whence arose the
name is quite unknown, and there is nothing in
the nature of any religious house here; but there
is, if you like to look at it in that way, a holy
calm in this sheltered spot, where the winds abate
and groups of dracæna palms grow freely.</p>

<p>But Tresco is the show-place in Scilly for
gardens. It is something under two miles to the
island of Tresco, where the residence of the Lord
Proprietor is situated. There is little left of the
Abbey buildings, and the residence so called is
quite modern. Beneath it is a rush-bordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
freshwater lake, and all around are subtropical
gardens, in which visitors are free to wander.
Here is a large shed partly built from the timbers
of wrecked vessels, whose figureheads form a
melancholy row in front. The old iron cresset in
which the coal-fires of St. Agnes lighthouse were
burnt until 1790, stands close by.</p>

<p>Tresco is two miles long. Visitors rarely go
beyond the Abbey gardens, but the walk along
to the northern extremity of the island is interesting,
commanding views on one side across
the narrow channel of New Grimsby to the island
of Bryher, and on the other across Old Grimsby
to St. Helen's, Menavawr, Round Island, Teän,
and St. Martin's. Here, in New Grimsby Harbour,
are the ruins of "Cromwell's Castle," and out in
the channel is Hangman's Island, where vague
legends say he hanged his prisoners. Not far off
are the ruins of Charles Castle. The shores are
thickly grown to the water's edge with vivid-coloured
mesembryanthemum, an alien plant,
which looks better than its name. And in the
cliffs on the headland is the dark cavern of "Piper's
Hole," running a long way in, with a stygian lake
in its midst and a boat to take you across to
further exploration, which is weirdly done by the
aid of torches.</p>

<p>The names of the Scilly rocks and islets are
themselves a pure delight, compact of romantic
suggestion. There, off Bryher, exposed to the full
fury of the Atlantic, are the two grim rocks called
Scilly, that confer a name upon the entire group;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
there is Maiden Bower, there are Mincarlo, Illiswilgie,
Great and Little Minalto, Carntop, Nundeeps,
the ominous Grim Rocks, Tearing Ledge,
Crebawethan and his little brother, Rosevean,
Rosevear, Daisy, Gorregan, Meledgan, Hellweathers,
and I know not how many others. And
weather permitting&mdash;a much more insistent condition
here than elsewhere&mdash;you may, with the aid
of experienced boatmen, come near them all, and
experience wonderful fishing and see strange
assemblages of solemn sea-birds grouped, fishing
also, but with unerring beak, from lonely ledges.</p>

<p>Great families of cormorants, shags, and puffins
inhabit these rocky places, subsisting upon fish.
The fishing methods of these birds differ entirely
from those of the gull, for they are clumsy in
flight and are expert rather in diving from cliffs than
soaring. It is not easy to frighten a cormorant,
and it is quite impossible to satisfy his ravenous
hunger, which has rendered the very name of
"cormorant" a synonym for greed and rapacity.
I have seen excursionists engage in the hopeless
task of trying to "shoo" a solemn conclave of
cormorants away by shouting, gesticulating, and
throwing stones, but those wise birds, better able
to judge distances in their native air than any
holiday-making townsfolk, do not so much as
deign to take notice of the disturbers, and witness
stones falling a quarter of a mile or so short with
all the contempt such marksmen deserve.</p>

<p>The shag is no doubt equally wise, but his is
an even more contemplative and much less active<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
wisdom than that of the cormorant. To see a
row of still and solemn shags, all black and white,
gazing into immensity from a shelf of rock is extraordinarily
parsonic in effect: just as though
one had come upon the Upper and Lower Houses
of Convocation in full session. But there is
humour among the clergy; no one has ever yet
observed it in a shag. The shags, indeed, are
extra-parsonic; more like fakirs in surplices.
They take life seriously, and look with a calm but
severe disapproval upon the laughter of strangers.</p>

<p>And strangers tend to increase in Scilly and its
surrounding seas, in spite of the voyage from
Penzance. The isles, truly the Fortunate Isles,
where there is no income-tax and there are no
motor-cars, and the post comes but once a day&mdash;and
sometimes not even then&mdash;and the only
police-force necessary is one officer, who combines
all ranks, and even then has little to do, are further
blest with a delightfully equable climate, and
good hotel and other accommodation. They look
with some pity upon the turmoils of the adjacent
island of Great Britain.</p>
